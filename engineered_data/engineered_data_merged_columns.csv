Personally, I want to know what‚Äôs good in Bangkok? Where‚Äôs good to party that‚Äôs not seedy? Nice areas to stay that‚Äôs close to other things. It‚Äôs not somewhere I‚Äôd choose to go but my husband is keen (with very little idea of what‚Äôs there).

A week roughly in Macedonia, then to Serbia where we have family and will remian for around 3 weeks.

Montenegro roughly 1 week

Bosnia roughly 10 days, Croatia roughly 10 days,

1 week in Slovenia

1 week in Hungary

1 week in Slovakia

1 week in Czech

Our primary form of transportation would be bus, train.

We would stay mainly in hostels, airbnbs, and family as we have a considerable amount spread around this region.

Our budget (each) is planned to be around 4-6 thousand dollars (CAD)

Is this feasible? We have been planning quite a lot and feel that this could be realistic.

But I would love and extremely appreciate some external opinions on this, especially concerning transport and travel times.

This summer my company will ask me to take all the holidays together in August.

Having a full month so I would like to organize a walk with my girlfriend, sleeping in tent or in hostels. 

Initially we thought about kungsleden (in sweden), in particular in order not to suffer from the heat of August. 

The night temperature around zero, however, made my girlfriend give up on doing it in a tent and always staying overnight in hostels seems prohibitive for the costs (it seems 50 euros per night, but maybe I'm wrong, I read it online). 

Do you have suggestions for walks with mild temperatures and affordable prices?

I am also interesting in seeing some of the cities but am more interested in nature, like the beach or mountains. I will be flying from the US. Below is the path I am planning on taking. Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

1. Fly into Puerto Vallarta. (4 days)
2. Guadalajara (4 days)
3. Guanajuato (4 days)
4. San Miguel de Allende (3 days)
5. Mexico City  (8 days with 2-3 of those days in Tolantongo to see the hot springs)
6. Puebla (3 days)
7. Oaxaca (5 days)
8. Puerto Escondido (4 days)
9. San Cristobal de las Casas (5 days)
10. Palenque (5 days)
11. Campeche (5 days)
12. Merida (5 days)
13. Izamal (1 day, pass through day)
14. Valladolid (7 days)
15. Tulum (7 days, seeing some friends here)
16. Cozumel (3 days)
17. Isla Mujeres (3 days, not planning on going to Cancun since I've been there already but heard diving in Isla Mujeres is very good)
18. Holbox (7 days)
19. Fly out of Cancun

It seems like most nature/beach activities are in Chiapas or the Yucatan Peninsula so I've planned to spend more time in those areas to see any ruins, cenotes or go diving. Any recommendations on 'must see' items around any of the cities I have listed?

I saw ADO runs mostly in cities south of Mexico City. What is the best way for me to get from Puerto Vallarta&gt;Guadalajara&gt;Guanajuato&gt;San Miguel de Allende&gt;Mexico City? Also, for some reason I couldn't find any buses that go from Puerto Escondido or even Oaxaca to San Cristobal de las Casas, so not sure the best way to get to San Cristobal.

I've heard from some folks on here that they don't allow you to stay any longer than 30-45 days even though as a US citizen I should be able to stay for 180 days. Is this still true and is there anything I need to do in advance that will allow me to stay at least 90 days?

I'm following a few travelling nomad youtubers, like Harald Baldr and in almost all of his videos, I've seen him only travelling with a backpack. But then if you've seen his Shrilanka videos where he's driving with a scooter from Bandarawela to Kandy he's got just a backpack, but then on an airport travelling from Shrilanka to Qatar, he's got an additional suitcase. How does this work? I've also figured out there is this thing called ""one-way rental"", where you rent a car/scooter on one location and leave it on another (I guess this is how many of these travel vloggers do it?), but regarding the luggage, does he ship it to another location or something? On the other hand Dale Philip always travels with a backpack only, which is optimal for mobility, but it's hard for me to imagine travelling to other part of the world with only like 2 pairs of clothing.

My questions are:

Is the stuff sack fine? I'm getting caught up on not finding a source outright announcing to ""just find something that can be hung from a tree"". It will be a little hefty for the first few days but it seems the bag could handle it...

Should I use an odor-proof bag for the food, then put that bag inside the bag which I hang?

How far from camp do I hang my goodies?

Is an odor-proof bag for trash something I should consider? It looks like the only thing it will contain is my ziplocs from pre-portioned meals. Is it a mortal sin to just put them back in with my food?

backpacking,1645645443,"What should I take with me on a backpacking trip across Portugal? Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

As you can guess, I‚Äôm planning a trip to Portugal. Besides, I‚Äôm planning to go backpacking there with my friend. Actually, my friend is from Portugal. He came to the US on the Erasmus college program, and we quickly became friends. So, before he left for good, he invited me to visit Portugal.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, he contacted me and asked if I wanna go backpacking during the Spring break. Of course, I said yes. I‚Äôve never been to Portugal before, and I haven‚Äôt even been to any European country before. Besides, I cannot say that I‚Äôve been on backpacking trips before, which involved visiting several cities. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not really sure what I should bring with me. I love walking long distances and can crosswalk the entire city, but I‚Äôve never walked to another city.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I‚Äôve started with some basic stuff, such as applying for a visa and browsing different places we will visit. Besides, I‚Äôve started to look for some stuff that I will definitely need with me, such as comfy boots, a cap, a couple of T-shirts, and some basic clothes. Also, I found the most important thing that I will need ‚Äî a backpack. I found one by Monos travel, but I dunno if they are suitable for trips like this or not. I know that they are high quality, but are they suitable for camping and backpacking?

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, what else should I bring with me? Because I also have to carry it on myself. We are starting our journey from Lisbon and planning to reach Nazare. It‚Äôs one small village famous for its gigantic waves. It attracts many professional surfers across the World. I have always dreamed of visiting this place, and I hope to still catch the giant waves season. Coz it finishes soon. Also, my friend wants to take me to Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros. He said that it‚Äôs a wonderful place.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope everything will go smoothly since it‚Äôs my first real backpacking trip.",0.004,0.863,0.133,0.9924,2021,345,73,28

That was about 25 years ago.

My equipment from that time is long gone.  I think I got a pretty good kit assembled, and am planning a shakedown trip at a park in my local area (1 overnight, 5 miles out, 5 miles back, relatively level terrain).

At this point, I'm trying to decide what my second trip should be.  Ideally, here's what I'm looking for.

Arrive Friday evening to make camp.

Hike Saturday.

Camp Saturday night.

Hike Sunday, return to car / home.

I would like this trip to be somewhere in Virginia, MD, or maybe the eastern edge of WV.  I would like a trip which is rewarding with views and whatnot.  I'm not opposed to trying something on the AT, but probably not the more difficult sections.

I would like to keep my total mileage for the trip below 12.

I know everybody's situation and circumstances are different, but every time I see people around my age or younger traveling to places like, Greece, the rainforest, Venice, etc. etc. etc. it makes me severely deflated and depressed knowing that I've never been out of my country of Canada.

I just can't fathom how it's done with having to pay rent, utilities, car insurance, food, and all of the other basic ""necessities"" each month, all while working a full-time job, and potentially for some, studying for an education as well.

For reference I've just turned 23yrs old and make $17.75/hr in Alberta (not much, but at least it's $2.75 above our minimum wage.) My parents have been divorced since I was a child, and at 16yrs old, they both stopped communicating with me, so money coming from them in the past or future isn't/wasn't a possibility at any point.

backpacking,1645456499,"Help with choosing a sturdy, multipurpose backpack Hey everyone, I am trying to decide between 2 backpacks. Here are the links to them both and then I'll get into the debate I'm currently having with myself:

The first one was recommended to me in a size medium by a REI employee after he measured me as a ""very solid medium."" Lots of cool features I like.

 [Amazon.com: Gregory Mountain Products Men's Baltoro 75 : Everything Else](https://www.amazon.com/Gregory-Mountain-Products-Baltoro-Backpack/dp/B073P34LF8/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1333708169271427&amp;hvadid=83356831527470&amp;hvbmt=bp&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=71527&amp;hvnetw=o&amp;hvqmt=p&amp;hvtargid=kwd-83357106086064%3Aloc-190&amp;hydadcr=2894_10630018&amp;keywords=gregory+baltoro+75+pack+-+men%27s&amp;qid=1645454080&amp;sr=8-1) 

The second one I found online after finding out that the Gregory lifetime warranty isn't all that, especially compared to Osprey's.

 [Amazon.com: Osprey Packs Men's Petrol Blue, O/S : Clothing, Shoes &amp; Jewelry](https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Packs-Farpoint-Travel-Backpack/dp/B07P5Z1D9K/ref=cs_sr_dp_2?crid=T9ZCREKKGRWQ&amp;keywords=osprey%2Bfarpoint%2B75&amp;qid=1645454504&amp;sprefix=osprey%2Bfarpoint%2B75%2Caps%2C82&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) 

What I am looking for is a multipurpose backpack that will last me a very long time for both wilderness camping and an upcoming backpacking trip to Europe (as well as future travels); **I prefer to have one backpack that works fairly adequately for both of these things rather than two backpacks that fit each of these purposes perfectly.**

**Gregory Pros:**

Comes with day bag and weather cover

It is sized, while the Osprey is one size and adjustable. I imagine that sized is better?

Seems to have better back support

The way it opens gives me a lot of good access

**Cons:**

The lifetime warranty really only covers factory defects (but I've also heard of people just getting new bags for sending their old one for wear and tear)

&amp;#x200B;

**Osprey Pros:**

The brand's true lifetime warranty which covers just about anything and everything

""Stowable aircover"" which I like because all the pockets on backpacks make me nervous about things falling off when checked in for a flight

The way it opens gives me a lot of good access

**Con:**

Perhaps the fact that it's adjustable might be a hassle?

&amp;#x200B;

Both are the size I want them to be (75 liters), around the same price (&lt; $260), and open wide, and though the Gregory seems like it will fit and support better, the Osprey has that true lifetime warranty that will make it so that I don't have to buy another backpack.

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback, advice, or alternative suggestions (below $300) are very welcome and appreciated!",0.017,0.832,0.151,0.9931,2760,348,104,18

backpacking,1645454709,"Backpacking with kids and bag size I'm looking at getting gear to take my little guy, he's 3 now and will likely be 4 by the time I get everything together, out on a 1-2 night backpacking trip. I'm stuck between the Osprey Atmos 65 and Osprey Aether 85. I'm leaning towards the larger pack because I will be carrying extra gear for my little guy. I also plan on bringing my wife and daughter when my daughter is a bit older which will mean even more gear then. I'm stuck because the Atmos was much more comfortable and about $120 cheaper than the Aether. Will 65 liters be enough for the larger trip given it will only be for 1-2 nights max and likely only a few miles out? Or should I invest in the larger pack to have the extra space? 
I did read that the Atmos can hold enough for a 10 day trip if need be but is better suited for 3-5. All I've learned is online so please let me know if I have anything wrong.

backpacking,1645446524,"Tips for backpacking southern South America for 5 months including work ?  

Hi Reddit,

From  next month onwards, I am planning to travel and work in the south of  South America. A quick overview of my itinerary is as follows:

March: Patagonia + Buenos Aires (living)

April: Buenos Aires (living) + little trips to Uruguay and cities around Buenos Aires

May:  Buenos Aires to Salta (fly/bus), then taking a bus towards Uyuni  (stopping along the way here and there), then towards Cochabamba to live  there

June: Living in Cochabamba + little trips around Cochabamba

July: Bus Trip to La Paz, to Cuzco/Macchu Pichu and to Lima

August: Lima to Iguazu Falls (fly) + Rio + Sao Paolo (then back home)

I have a couple questions, seeking advice:

1. Is  this itinerary reasonable, considering I have to work pretty much 4-5  months full time? I am backpacking and have a relatively quick traveling  pace (not seeking too much comfort and luxury)
2. Flight from Buenos Aires to Salta? Or worth to take a bus and stop in Rosario and C√≥rdoba for example?
3. Is Paraguay (Asuncion then bus to Iguazu) worth a visit apart from Iguazu Falls?
4. Is  Iguazu from the Brazilian side 'sufficient' or is it very much worth it  to take a bus to the Argentinian side as well? Considering covid hassle  etc. as well?
5. From Iguazu in Brazil, is Rio and Sao Paolo worth about a (small) week? Or should I add in Florianopolis as well for example?

Thanks in advance for any tips :) And feel free to ask anything.",0.008,0.879,0.113,0.9737,1498,263,79,17

French press coffee makers are the best tools for making instant coffee in camps. Here I want to introduce you to models suitable for camping because of their specific design.

Regular glass french presses are a bit delicate and may break in your backpack. But, special camping models are made of stainless steel and ABS plastic which are quietly unbreakable if falling from your hand or bag.

&amp;#x200B;

[widesea french press](https://preview.redd.it/omr650epazi81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4174e61f4869c7b2229106c2eabf48716b7ee4f)

&amp;#x200B;

1- WideSea

It is a camping french press made of aluminum and can be used as a water boiling pot. More information is in the link below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Icafilas french press](https://preview.redd.it/xacilyjrazi81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d551d993e55d3571f931cf797c5aa5a995429042)

&amp;#x200B;

2- Icafilas french press

This model is made of ABS food-grade plastic and can provide you with hot french coffee. Due to its double wall design, your coffee remains hot for long hours while you are in camp. The exterior body is made from stainless steel, which increases product lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3- Lixada camping french press

Like the first model, it can be used as a water boiling pot and french press. By this one, you won't need any extra boiling pot. You can brew the coffee as soon as the water is boiled.

This summer, I'll be solo travelling for the first time, the destination I have in mind is Nepal, Mt Everest Base Camp trek.

I have a lot of questions about the guides or porters I should take, the food there, the cost etc. if anyone has experience, I would really appreciate you helping me :).

Firstly, I anticipate 2-4 weeks for the hike and generally Nepal and would like to keep the costs as low as possible.

Also do you think it'll be fine to travel from Europe to Nepal this summer, without any risk of cancellation of my flight due to covid-19?

&amp;#x200B;

I would prefer to spend around $700-$1200 for the hike with a guide or porter I don't know what's best. However, I saw a lot of people recommending to hire a guide once I'm in Nepal (probably land in Kathmandu), I've never done something like that, I like to plan it in advance so it's not stressful to look for a guide last minute. Nevertheless, if it is a lot cheaper than the expensive treks I found on the internet, I'd love to get one once I'm in Nepal.

Do you have any advice for me on how easy it is to find a local guide or porter there, how expensive it is and if it is safe/any recommended ways or spots I can find them? Also if there are any good treks that aren't to expensive on the internet you can also recommend them.

Additionally, will the food and accomodation be included in the trekking package from the locals(guide) there? **If not, will I be able to buy food and drinks at every spot we sleep at** and do you recommend me to take some and water with me in my backpack? 

Do I get a lot of free time to explore the environment after a day of trekking and are there any activities to do at the stops like visit some villages, explore local cultures etc.

Also is there a really beautiful night sky at the spots we sleep, where I can see lots of stars, planets and generally the milky way?

Do you have any advice what I should take with me to do the trek and any precautions to take?

How much would the trip approximately cost me including food, water, accomodation and the guide, really trying to keep it cheap, just want to enjoy nature.

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate any answer, you don't have to answer everything, some questions would already mean a lot!

In contrast, Venus' revolution around the Sun is relatively fast, with an orbital velocity of 35.02 km/s and an orbital period equivalent to 224.7 days (5392.8 hours) on Earth. Therefore, a day of Venus is longer than a year.Is it true?

I first want to know if you think a Lexus RX330 will be able to make it up the road to the trailhead. It has a little bit of clearance and I've taken it on some really hairy stuff to get to 14ers in Colorado. I think it should be ok, but I am curious as to how rough the dirt road to the trailhead actually is.


Next, I am wondering what the water situation is in March. I know that Sedona gets an average of about 2 inches of rain during the month, so I am curious about the likelihood of there being available water out in the backcountry (trip is supposed to be March 6th-9th if that changes anything). I'm not really used to backpacking anywhere without an abundance of water, so any guidance about this is appreciated.

So I'm Brazilian and planning a 3 months trip on europe. I'm planning to take with me a light bag that I can use everyday, visiting museums, walking around the cities etc. In addition, for my clothes, towell, and other stuff (that don't need to be always around me) i'm' thinking about [this 50L (40 + 10) backpack](https://www.decathlon.es/es/p/mochila-de-viaje-hombre-50l-travel-500/_/R-p-156348?mc=8383140&amp;c=GRIS). 

The prices for the exact same bag in Brazil (where I live and where I'm traveling from) and in Spain (my first european destination) are very different. Here in Brazil it costs around 120 Euros, and in Spain 80 Euros.

So my first idea was to take a dufflebag [(like this one per example)](https://www.decathlon.com.br/mala-de-futebol-kipocket-55-litros/p?aSku=Cor:bordeaux&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc-search&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAu62QBhC7ARIsALXijXRvW4qu_i4R_u5_s3mJ9_S4LoMlZ3N0bKHEfQc5W_ovSV_NiW91YQcaAvCIEALw_wcB) in my first flight (from Brazil to Spain) and than when i get there, buy the 50L backpack (thinking about saving 40 Euros).

Hi everyone,

I'm planning a backpacking trip to Europe this summer and I'm having a bit of difficulty with the bags logistics.

\- How big of a hiking backpack would you need for a few months of travel (about 2-3 months) with camping gear? I currently have a 24L daypack that I like, and it sucks because I'm realizing I should have just bought a bigger capacity bag with a removable daypack because I would also want to bring along a smaller day pack. And I don't think it's feasible to bring my 24L and have a separate 44L-ish backpack and carry both around as I move from city to city... I'm also barely 5'3 and 95lbs and would honestly prefer to travel light.

\- What's the biggest size bag you've been able to use as a carry on? I know this varies from airline to airline, but the general rule of thumb I'm hearing is anything bigger than 45L will probably have to be checked in.

\- Do you personally have a bag you'd recommend for months of travel?

Regardless of the questions above, any backpacking advice for a first timer would be really appreciated!

I've been looking at backpacks but I'm struggling to figure out which one would be best, because of the wide array of options.
I'm debating on getting one with a detachable daypack on it, but am not 100% sure on that since I have other options for a daypack and the main backpack is most important to me. 
I would like to be able to use the backpack in the future, when traveling to Southern America for example.

Some backpacks I've been looking at are:
- Osprey Archeon 45 for women
- Osprey fairfew 55
- Salkan backpacker (seems very nice but wouln't get it because of the high price)

There is going to be a good amount of elevation change on the second (250m up and back down and 200m up and down) and third day (300m up and back down) but other than that the rest will be fairly average terrain. 

I have two cameras and I'm torn with what I want to bring and wouldn't mind some input from what you guys use and bring with you while on multi day hikes. Is it worth it to sacrifice weight for amazing photos? The rest of my gear is light enough that an overnight hike wouldn't be an issue but with 4 days of food it looks like it might be getting a bit tight (haven't done a mock packing yet) 

Sony A7s with 24-240mm lens.

Pros
-compact and Light (1445g with batteries, camera and lens)
-One lens that covers me for almost anything
Cons
-Lens is not too fast (f3.5-f6.3)
-Lens is not the widest
-Battery life is terrible so lots of batteries are needed

Canon 1D4 with 17-40mm f4 and 70-200mm f2.8

Pros
-My main camera (better quality image)
-Battery lasts forever so I would only need one for the 4 day hike
-Fast lens with enough zoom for wildlife photography too
Cons 
-My main camera
-HEAVY (3324g with both lenses and body)
-Not compact

backpacking,1644769576,"Boots for Skye Trail Hi, I'm preparing for walking the Skye Trail in May. We will be backpacking and wildcamping. I don't do this kind of trips often - usually day hikes in UK, Alps, Tatra mountains etc. I was hoping to tap into collective wisdom about hiking boots. 

I've narrowed down the selection to Scarpa Mistral and Scarpa Revolution. Both feel great, but obviously the 

Revos are a bit higher, more restrictive and slightly heavier and seem better built. They are not uncomfortable, but they feel more rigid - sort of like ski boots.

Mistrals on the other hand seem to be much more flexible (mid height), seem lighter (although the difference is only 60g per boot) and I feel like I could run the trail in them. Walking seems more natural and less rigid or restrictive. 

My questions:

1. Are Mistrals going to be good enough for trail like that (and potentially for other odd multiday hikes)?

2. Based on their description on Scarpa's website, Revolutions seem more suitable for the trail - do they offer anything Mistrals dont that would be worth the slight comofrt tradeoff?

Does some of you guys have experience with other routes or advice they would like to share that can help me making a rough plan of direction ? Any other advice on SA is also welcome since it will be my first time there.

## Chefechouen

Chefchouen is one of the loveliest small cities of Morocco. It is nicknamed The Blue City or The Pearl of Morocco. Its blue walls, houses, hotels, restaurants and buildings make the city unique among all the other cities in Morocco. While you are visiting this brilliant city, you will notice that its architecture is Andalusian with an Arabic touch. Chefchouen is one of the favourite destinations for foreigners and Moroccans as well. Its charming beauty offers great opportunities to take pictures. One of the things you will notice in this city is that photographers hold their high-quality cameras staring at places to take a perfect photo that holds more than one meaning. The Pearl of Morocco (Chefchouen) is located in the breath-taking Rid mountains, northwest Morocco.  The old medina is what makes Chefchouen a beautiful attraction in Morocco. It is where you can spot the main square that is lined with local cafes and restaurants. Chefchouen is well-known for its Souq (traditional market), Kasbah (kind of fortified Medina), blue alleys, the church (currently a theatre) and the way people dress.

Chefchouen was built in 1471 and found an ideal place to shop by tourists for its interesting and pure handicrafts that are rare to find in other Moroccan cities. Besides Muslims, Moriscos and Jews settled in this city.

Chefchaouen can be fully explored while on our [Marrakech to Chefchaouen desert tour](https://www.marrakech-desert-trips.com/tours/marrakech-to-chefchaouen-via-sahara-desert-and-fes/).¬†

## Toubkal National Park

Toubkal National Park is one of hikers‚Äô top choices in the world. It is situated in the High Atlas Mountains. Jbel Toubkal is the second highest peak in Africa at 13.671 feet (4267 meters). [Climbing Jbel Toubkal](https://www.marrakech-desert-trips.com/tours/3-days-toubkal-ascent/) is one of the amazing experiences that hikers and visitors appreciate. On the way to the top of the mountain, there are many Berber villages such as Imlil village (1.800 above the sea level) where you can observe people‚Äôs culture and lifestyle. Such trip to Toubkal National Park makes the visitor enjoy the panoramic views and fascinating landscapes.

## Essaouira (Mogador)

Essaouira city is one of the oldest cities in Morocco that lies on the Atlantic coast. Its medina, which characterized by its European architecture, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has also witnessed many civilizations such as the Portuguese occupation in the 15th century. This amazing city has interesting places that worth visiting such as:

The remparts (Skc ala de la Kasbah). They were magnificently built by European engineers. They are a must-see place that provide an incredible view overlooking the Atlantic coast. These ramparts are usually admired by visitors.

The authentic fishing port is one of the most famous attractions in Essaouira. Here, you can see the small blue fishing boats that are made of wood. Having fresh seafood for lunch is one of the highly recommended things to do in Essaouira.

Taking a stroll alongside the beach. In fact, Essaouira‚Äôs beach is one of the surfers‚Äô top choices in the world because of the unstoppable wind over the year. Besides surfing; visitors could experience riding camels, horseback or quad biking.

Furthermore, Essaouira is famous for Gnaoua Festival that is held in June every year. This festival is an opportunity for Gnaoua musicians to meet this style of music fans. Jazz and Rock musicians are usually welcomed to attend and perform as well. It represents the culture and West African music.

Managed to get some time of uni and some ¬£8 return flights to Riga from Wed to Sunday so obviously I took it! The flight is late on wed and lunchtime on Sunday so I only have three full days in Riga. 

I‚Äôm aware Riga is a pretty small city and could probably be done in 1/2 days. The hostel I was planning on staying in (a more lively sociable one) is only available for two nights out of the four. Do you reckon I should go to Vilnius on the fri morning and come back on Sat night or spend my whole time in Riga?

This would give me three nights in Latvia and one in Vilnius but only one full day in Riga, and I would get just over 24h in Vilnius.

I'd imagine that it is very different now especially with social distancing and other covid-related measures. I'm interested in:  
1) What happens if someone gets COVID during their stay? Has anyone have had experiences with that?   
2) Do hostels accept people that need to quarantine or do I have to book an Airbnb for that?

backpacking,1643920280,"Need some advisement on Cirque of the Towers, Wind River Range, Wyoming! Hi! 

I'm trying to get an idea of exactly *how bad* Texas Pass and Jackass Pass are on the Cirque of the Towers trail in Wyoming. I'm a seasoned backpacker with my last trip being The Enchantments in Washington (look up Aasgard Pass for reference), but my husband and I want to try and take our (will be then) 10 month old with us on this trip to the Wind River Range.

We have a fantastic Osprey pack/carrier (Osprey Poco Plus) for her to ride comfortably in, but I'm trying to gauge what the footing is like on these passes. Being experienced in difficult backpacking I'm not worried about my stamina or strength to be able to make it up the passes, I'm just trying to figure out if the scramble has mostly solid footing or if it's a lot of gravelly slippery very inclined footing. She's pretty petite now, but if the footing is extremely sketchy I may feel more comfortable bringing an extra tight fitting carrier for her to ride in the front on those parts.

My girlfriend and I (UK-based) are planning a year-long backpacking trip in 2023 (Covid permitting!) and are looking for recommendations for destinations in the second half of the year. 

Our fixed(ish) plans are to depart London for Toronto in late December 2022 to visit my girlfriend‚Äôs Dad, after which we‚Äôll probably fly to Mexico and travel south through Central America until late April. We‚Äôll then return to the UK in May for a wedding before resuming our travels in June. 

The issue is we‚Äôre not sure where to travel or what route to take from the UK in June. Europe is the obvious option as it‚Äôll be Summertime but we‚Äôve already travelled Europe extensively so are both keen to go further afield. However, Australia and New Zealand (both top picks for us) will be in Winter, and India (another) will be in monsoon season until September from what I‚Äôve read‚Ä¶ 

So we‚Äôd be very grateful for any recommendations as to routes or countries/regions that are good to travel (climate, crowds etc) during this period of the year. My only idea currently is Japan, which I‚Äôve heard is nice in June.

On another note, does anyone whose travelled as a couple/pair have any advice on overall budgets for a year-long trip? We‚Äôre planning to save roughly ¬£27,000/$36,000 between us by the time we leave.

Paris is truly one of those places that has it all when it comes to romance. Indeed, love is a never-ending source of inspiration for artists, and the city of Paris pay tribute to the sentiment. Whether you embark on a cruise down the Seine river, stroll over lamplit bridges or have a date at rooftop restaurants, Paris never fails to romance. If you are looking for romantic things to do in the coming Valentine Day, I have a bunch of ideas to share with you. Hope you find this post useful!

# ROMANTIC STROLLS

ROUTE 1: SEINE RIVER ‚Äì PONT ALEXANDER III ‚Äì NOTRE-DAME ‚Äì BERTHILLON ICE CREAM

The Seine river is one of the most gorgeous route in Paris, with a lot of pretty bridges and tree-shaded promenades. Parisian couples love to go for a walk along the Seine riverside, enjoy a fierce sunset over the river or sit on wooden benches on the bridges.

Start your journey from the crossing Alexander III (near Petit Palais). It is the French historic monument, bearing the witness to the diplomatic relationship between France and Russia after Franco-Russian Alliance established in 1892. The wealth of its decor, and the plenty of sculptures and Art Nouveau lamps are the bridge at its most beautiful.

Stroll along the river‚Äôs bank to the islands, the √éle de la Cit√©. On the way, you will pass by Pont Neuf covered in padlocks ‚Äì the locks are attached by couples who throw the key into the Seine as a symbol of eternal love.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pont Alexander III](https://preview.redd.it/cx8kcto5qff81.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb32a1076ae5f3ef1703a7b80cbf735c032a0084)

Also spend time to admire the splendor of cathedral of Notre-Dame. Set for the background in the novel ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame‚Äù by Victor Hugo, the cathedral remains glamour and mystery that attract visitors from all over the world. Since the fire in 2019, it is now temporarily closed and under restoration but you can see the cathedral from Jean-Paul II square.

The next stop is Berthillon ice cream settled on √éle St-Louis island. This is very famous ice-cream shop founded in 1954, offering 70 flavors, such as apricot, peach, pear, mango, raspberry sorbet, and salted butter caramel (two scoops of ice cream ¬£7, pastries from ¬£2).

Address: 31 rue saint louis en l‚Äôile, 75004 Paris

&amp;#x200B;

[Pont des arts](https://preview.redd.it/rf708uy7qff81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba9f97b57f6b2ed3ba789034955d565272a5261)

ROUTE 2: TUILERIES GARDEN ‚Äì LOUVRE MUSEUM ‚Äì LE SOUFFOT CAFE ‚Äì LUXEMBOURG GARDEN

Paris has plenty of bewitching gardens that make non-Paris residents jealous of. As the middle of February, the weather is still cold and the sky usually falls in grey, but you still can enjoy outdoor walk through gardens (suggest to visit during the afternoon and evening). For this walking tour, you will pass by two of the most famous gardens in Paris: Tuileries garden and Luxembourg garden. Also keep in mind that those places are always full of tourists and you shall watch out for the pickpockets too.

Start your journey from Tuileries garden (French: Jardin des Tuileries). It is an Italian-styled garden, situated between Louvre and the Place de la Concorde in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. Simply have a leisurely rest by sitting on metal chairs around the pond or walk along the tree-lined road, you‚Äôll find an array of statues and historic artifacts. At the end of the garden path, spend time to admire Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, the splendid gateway was built to commemorate Napoleon‚Äôs military victories. The Louvre museum is just several steps away from the Arc, don‚Äôt hesitate to stop by and take a picture of glass pyramid in the front of the museum and relish the architecture of Louvre Palace before leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

[Luxembourg garden](https://preview.redd.it/ronrhdoaqff81.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6074c3f912c67c48b15fefae205a9c9fa815de)

Le Soufflot cafe is the next stop on this itinerary as you have walked a lot and need to recharge energy! Le Soufflot cafe is a cozy cafe shop in a narrow alley looking over Panth√©on (a history monument). The terrace tables are charming to sit outside while tasting great food or sipping a cup of cafe. I recommend Escalope of salmon as a main course and cream puffs as deserts to finish your meal (drinks from ‚Ç¨4 and food from ‚Ç¨12.8).

Now come to Luxembourg garden ((French: Jardin du Luxembourg) which is created in 1612 by Marie de‚Äô Medici, the widow of King Henry IV who wanted to construct Luxembourg Palace for her new residence. Hidden in greenery, the garden covers 23 hectares and is famous for its picturesque fountains, pretty flowerbeds, and sculptures. Explore the garden as well as Jardin des Grands Explorateurs on the extended part of the garden.

# DECLARE YOUR LOVE PUBLICLY

Like every year, the City of Paris offers you the opportunity to declare your love on the capital‚Äôs digital boards. Write your most beautiful words up to 145 characters, declaration of love or marriage proposal and your words will take spotlight on the public board. The campaign ends by Monday, 7th February at noon! Paris residents and tourists can submit their words via the official city‚Äôs [website](https://www.paris.fr/pages/saint-valentin-declarez-votre-amour-dans-tout-paris-7469). Selected persons will be informed by email.

In addition, there is another way to make love public. Head to Jehan Rictus garden in Montmartre where you will find a wall with ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù written 311 times in 250 different languages. It was created by calligraphist Fr√©d√©ric Baron and mural artist Claire Kito, currently opened to the public free of charge. What a beautiful way of delivering a Valentine‚Äôs message!

# VISIT MUSEUMS

MUS√âE RODIN

***‚ÄúSoir√©e Love‚Äù*** ‚Äì ***Love tour on Monday 14th of February 2022, from 7 to 11pm***

My girlfriend and I are planning a 2-3 week holiday to South America this year. Probably around  May-October. We‚Äôre mostly into nature and hiking. Especially mountains. We need some advice on where to go.

Right now we're looking at Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. What's important for us?

* Having good scenery/nature and getting around easy enough
* Safe (enough)
* Being a bit cheaper is a big plus
* I prefer countries that don‚Äôt require a negative covid test (we are vaccinated and boostered, though)**.** I don't want to risk ruining our holiday because of a positive test. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, next year we would like to do South America for 3 months (perhaps Patagonia?). So in the ideal situation, I don‚Äôt want to do the same country twice.

What countries would be advisable? Which aren't? Especially with covid at the back of my mind...

I will be traveling through central America for about 4 months staring in march this year. For this (and future trips ofc) I want to buy a new backpack. I have a few things to consider:

- I don't like overpacking, but do want to be comfortable enough. This lead me to a 45L pack.
- Preferably I'd like my pack to fit as a carry on (although I have the option for checked luggage) as I'd like to use it more often for different kinds of trips.
- I love hiking but I will probably rent my gear when I need it so I won't need the space for a multi day trip + all my other stuff. 
- I found both backpacks for around ‚Ç¨200 so pricing will not be an issue.
- I will take a foldable daypack with me on my trips.

I love the accessibility of the Osprey but like that the Deuter has a bottom compartment and the +10L. Although I'm not sure I will use it as a 55L bag.

2. If you think now is a good time to go, which places would you recommend to be most hospitable and welcoming in a post covid world for a 24 year old backpacker? (Europe, South &amp; Central America, south east Asia?)

That's why I thought it would be great to have a tool that allows you to upload and tag your items. You could then share it on Reddit, search through existing backpacking setups, search for specific products/packing lists, etc.

Because I don't want to build something that no one will use, I created some mockups to validate the idea with the community. If the feedback is positive, I'll start building it.

Has anyone ever buy flight/train/bus tickets from [Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com)? Is it legit and work without problems? 

I checked trip from Prague to Bologna with train from website [idos.cz](https://idos.cz) and it said that the total cost would be 3,133 czk or around 128 euro. I will have to go to Munich and change the train there.  However, when i checked from [Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com), the price is 59 euro, and with the same route. The difference is just that with [idos.cz](https://idos.cz) I will use EC for both trains, but with [Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com) i will use Ceske Drahy's train from Prague to Munich, and use Trenitalia's train from Munich to Bologna.

To be honest, I don't even know that Trenitalia can go to Munich, i thought that it covers only areas inside Italy.

Hope this is allowed, posting for an educational non-profit if that helps :)

My name is ""*terrainexposure*"" and I'm the Backcountry Education and Training Manager with an educational non-profit ranch camp in Northwest Wyoming. Founded in 1930s, we've been running some pretty epic backcountry trips in the Tetons, Yellowstone, and surrounding areas for over 80 years, and we're looking to hire/train a few new Backpacking Trip Leaders to lead trips this summer. I was a Backpacking Trip Leader for multiple seasons, and I absolutely loved my time leading trips. As far as summer jobs in the outdoor industry go, it's genuinely one of the best ones you'll find(especially if you're pretty new in the industry). If you're an experienced backpacker looking for your first paid leadership gig, this could be it. Our trips range from \~3-6 days, and our trip leaders serve as risk managers, backcountry educators, and everything in between both on trail and at the ranch. 

Trip Leader Training starts in mid-late may(after finals, for those of you in college), and our season wraps up in mid-august. Compensation includes a flat salary + travel reimbursement + room and board on our 1000+ acre property for your entire period of employment. It's a really special place and a fantastic group of people. The qualities we're looking for include excellent decision-making skills, professionalism, plus some previous backcountry experience. This job involves lots of leading, mentoring, and educating young people, so it is crucial to be excited about that. If you're interested in learning more, please shoot me a message and we can set up a time to chat in the next few days.

backpacking,1643307355,"Transitioning from hiker to backpacker, general advice needed! Sorry for the long winded post, the research I've done has been a lot to digest and I‚Äôm struggling to piece together the last bits of a trip I‚Äôm planning on taking in the near future.

To give a bit of backstory: My experience level as of now has consisted of lengthy day hikes. Friends and I will pack the necessary gear for a day, drive and park at trail heads, complete the hike, and return home. While this has been fun and as my experience with them has increased, this approach has become extremely limiting in terms of how far we can go/what we can accomplish in one day. The obvious next step would be overnight backpacking. I understand this comes with a whole new set of required gear and skills, and I‚Äôve been doing research daily to prepare. The next step is actually getting out there and making the mistakes to improve with time and experience.

With that being said, my first question: those who backpack, how exactly do you plan your multi day trips? Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking, but I‚Äôm struggling to understand the logistics of it all. How do you approach transportation to the trail head? Do you rent a car if coming from out of state? Do you drive and leave your car for multiple days at the trail head until you circle back to it later? Prior to the trip and obviously depending on the trail/destination, do you generally plan ahead on where you plan on stopping for each night, or just wing it the day of? Do you generally tend to stick to trails with designated campsites along the way or prefer dispersed camping?

With my prior experience there‚Äôs always been a definite goal: drive to trail, complete trail, get back to car and go home. I‚Äôve never had to worry about potential stops, sorting out campsites, permits, etc. and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs worrying me.

&amp;nbsp;

Once I get a better understanding for the above question, I plan on taking some shorter solo overnight trips locally in the SoCal area to gain experience. Which then brings me to my next question, recommendations for a longer trip with friends. The plan is 2-3 days in mid May in the Pacific Northwest. I‚Äôm seeing a lot of recommendations for the Hoh River trail and High Divide loop in Olympic national park. Both seem heavily trafficked, have a ton of research on them readily available, and seem challenging yet do-able for my skill level. Does anybody care to share their experience with these and have any tips to share? By no means am I set on these though, so if you have suggestions in the Northern California, Oregon, or Washington area, feel free to share. I want to expand outside of SoCal more than anything.

If there was any resource in particular that helped you make that transition from hiking to backpacking, whether it be a certain website, reddit guide, book, etc. please share that as well! I'll take any advice at this point",0.035,0.848,0.116,0.9925,2902,510,55,28

The problem is that along with the stereotypical backpacking destinations in Australia and elsewhere I am also quite a keen hiker, climber and camper but I don‚Äôt want to pack too much! I already have a nice big 50l osprey bag that I was thinking for checkin luggage that would carry all my hiking and climbing gear with room to spare so to be honest I probably could fit everything in there but it might be a squeeze and I am thinking I need another bag I won‚Äôt take hiking and can keep normal life things in such as ipad and clothes etc  as carry on - this could also double as a city or a day hike bag - do you see my problem! For reference I am about 5‚Äô8‚Äù woman UK size 10.

I have been looking around and the main backpacking travel bag that comes up is the osprey farpoint 40l which is carry on size which I really like the clam opening style but I am afraid it won‚Äôt do for day hikes. Has anyone used this and had any problems? I could go smaller for hiking day bag that would fit as carry on but it wouldn‚Äôt be as accessible as a clam style bag and would be compromising on space (though I reckon 70 -80l would be plenty altogether). Although I am an advocate for big packs not packed full and cinched to be smaller haha but they need to be comfortable.

Has anyone done big backpacking trips and included hiking/climbing/camping gear? how often do backpackers take more than one bag? Please let me know what bag sizes you normally take and any tips because this is my first big big solo trip!",0.027,0.86,0.113,0.9826,1703,323,30,13

This is my first post here,  I'm 17 and looking to go on a 1-month backpacking trip across Europe, the summer after I turn 18. I've never traveled outside the US, and I'm a bit nervous of expenses and safety, as I will be solo. Some key questions of mine are: 

1. About how much would 1 month in Europe cost? (avoiding touristy areas, staying in hostels, basically being as frugal as possible.
2. How dangerous is it? My family thinks I'm crazy for wanting to go in the first place, and that I will be kidnapped or something. Their fear and doubt are getting to me so, does anyone have any experience in that area?
3. Are hostels okay?
4. Best transportation tips?
5. Is it better to plan where I will be staying every night ahead, or wing it and work it out as I go?
6. Would anyone recommend it, even though I'll be 18 aka really young?

Thank you anyone who replies, It's a lifelong dream to travel, and I'm finally old enough to start planning,

backpacking,1642999546,"Creepy Backpacking Story New to Reddit, but saw a thread about creepy backpacking stories on Instagram, wanted to post here since an IG comment isn‚Äôt true to storytelling.
It was 2020, sometime in July. My (now) fianc√©e and I took her best friend on her first backpacking trip to Marquette, MI, area after we‚Äôd gone for 5 years. The trip was shitty, caring for somebody who wasn‚Äôt ready for it, but there was one day that made for one of the worst experiences of my life.
We were temporarily camping near MQT, a few miles out of town, and drove about 50-75 miles west to visit an abandoned logging town from the early 1900‚Äôs. Me and my fianc√©e had hiked here and toured the site before a year prior, eerie, but nothing serious. A cool day hike within range of our campsite that we could reach and return from before sunset. 
We arrive as the rain ends rather early in the morning, some time after 10am. We gear up, and the three of us hike in. No human presence, no tracks, scant evidence that the DNR had weedwhacked the month prior. Mosquitos were horrible. We hike in about 20 minutes or so, and suddenly the forest goes silent. We were so pestered by mosquitos we all didn‚Äôt notice. About 5-10 minutes later, we stumble into what we think is a former campsite - cleared brush, saplings cut for firewood, and two campfires that had been extinguished. Don‚Äôt think much of it until we check the second fire, and it‚Äôs still warm. We‚Äôre all chilled, decided to keep going to the abandoned town. 
About 5 minutes later, we all nope the fuck out. Come across a small, muddy bog from the morning rain. In it, there‚Äôs tracks from a large man‚Äôs boot, and tracks from a large dog, and they‚Äôre running perpendicular to the trail and off into thick brush. All of the sudden the ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô ‚Äòwatched‚Äô feeling we got walking through the suddenly silent woods made perfect sense. It was like someone was deliberately avoiding the trail to avoid being seen, but had left when they heard us coming and were watching us. Mind you, this is in a place people genuinely DO NOT GO. It‚Äôs far out, there‚Äôs little to see, it‚Äôs never monitored.
We turned tail and returned to the car, but the ‚Äòwatched‚Äô feeling persisted until we left. 
First time I was ever happy to be open carrying - absolutely terrifying being so far from help, no service, in a place nobody would look with a mysterious stranger. We rode back to our camp in silence, the three of us still talk about that day once in awhile.",0.107,0.79,0.103,-0.6344,2470,448,52,26
backpacking,1642997305,"What do I need to know about Teton Crest Trail? Was able to get some passes for Teton Crest Trail July 18-22. I didn‚Äôt have a ton of time to map it out so I followed clever hikers online trip plan of upper granite -&gt; fox creek -&gt; Alaska basin -&gt; outlier (was supposed to be holly lake but was full) campsites. The Alaska basin to outlier is the current cause for concern. I can handle a longer push like that (looks like 14ish) but I need to map out the elevation better. Anyone done this stretch? Any thoughts here?

I am experienced backpacker, traveling with 2 other experienced backpackers and one moderately experienced backpacker. We‚Äôre well aware of bear danger, will have bear spray and canisters and so on. Also will stay dialed into weather for chance of ice axe and crampon/yak tracks. From what I‚Äôve seen water looks pretty easy especially that time of year from snow melt. 

Any advice, tips, tricks or things you with you would have done/known/brought/left at home? This‚Äôll be my time in Teton and the Jackson area in general so welcome any advice. 

Also my wife and 2.5 year old little man will be hanging in Jackson while we backpack, so any good reco‚Äôs in town or short trails for kids would be sweet too.

backpacking,1642984796,"We need your help! Unprepared 5 days / 4nights on Trek W in Patagonia Hi there! My two daughters (ages 21 and 22) and I are going on a hiking and camping trip on the Trek W trail in Patagonia in a few weeks. Please don't laugh too hard but we've only ever done day hikes and I have traveled long distances bicycling and camping solo self-supported.  I won't tell you the whole backstory but this was sort of an turn of events. Long story short, we are grossly unprepared. What we've read is that the weather is very unpredictable and changes quickly and there can be very high winds. I'm looking for advice on how to pull this together, what to pack, how to pack and not overpack, and really ANY and ALL advice on any aspect of it that you think might be useful and prevent this from being too much of a hot mess. Any advice on food would be greatly appreciated. We thought we should just do dehydrated food. FYI, we are all vegetarians. Also, we are hoping to leave our packs at the camp on a couple of the days but it feels excessive to bring our day packs also. Any thoughts on that? We also have hiking sock confusion. For our day hikes, we have one pair of darn tough socks, some really thick cheap hiking socks from Amazon and I have some merino wool cycling socks. We aren't sure which we should buy. Base layers, same situation, mostly random things from skiing once a year with one pair of hot chilis and one pair of merino wool mixed in.

We just bought three Osprey Kyte 46 backpacks. I thought we should buy smaller packs so we have to pack less. Other things that we own from hiking, camping and my bikepacking are:

Marmot Tungsten UL 3P Tent (for my daughters), no footprint. Is it too light weight?

REI Half-Dome 2P (my tent)

We all have hiking boots and trekking poles. However, my older daughter's boots had an issue on our last hike and we had to buy a new pair so that's not great. We plan to walk with our packs every night and so hopefully, her shoes will break in a little.

2x Nemo Disco Down Sleeping Bags (we are short one bag)

I have an MSR pocketrocket 2 stove and a pot. We plan to just do dehydrated food.

2x sleeping matts (short a matt, have one ancient thermarest and one from my zen bivy setup)

3x sleeping bag liners (2 are fleece)

3x day hydration packs

A giant mish mosh of hiking pants (my younger daughter has no hiking pants) and base layers (most base layers from skiing).

3x rain jackets (nothing special, just our rain jackes)

3x rain pants

1 camp pillow (what can I say? I like my pillow)

We are renting 3 down jackets.

I have been finding amazing information through Reddit and other forums to get the ball rolling. I would love to find someone who has backpacked through other countries to pick your brain on some general questions and what situations to expect through the journey.

**Rough details of the trip:**

* Around two months but flexible on the return date
* Most likely will buy unlimited EUrail pass
* Traveling on budget but open to spending to get the most out of this experience
* Solo
* Dublin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest, Venice, Barcelona, Libson are some of the places I would like to visit but willing to adjust (rough plan to fly into Dublin, Depart home from Libson)

I am sure I am leaving out important details but I just wanted to get this post out there early to see if anyone has any tips or advice for me in these beginning planning stages.

We thought about two main options. First one being crossing borders all the way to Costa Rica (Peru-Colombia-Panama-CR) and from there we'd take a flight to Mexico or Cuba. The other possibility is going from Peru to Chile and take a flight somewhere else once we're done there (probably Mexico, Cuba or Costa Rica).

Main drawback of Chile is that I don't know much about the country and I'm afraid it'd be more similar to Peru society than, let's say Costa Rica or Cuba. I'd love to visit the Patagonia, but I much rather prefer travel to Center America instead if that means a bigger cultural variety.

Leopards in the Yala National Park. Udawalawe and Minneriya elephants Blue whales off the coast of Mirissa. Sri Lanka is one of the world's premier wildlife viewing sites. While you're likely to see animals around the country, the finest wildlife encounters are almost always found in national parks.

Yala National Park has a range of ecosystems, ranging from open parkland to thick rainforest, flooded lagoons, and coastal dunes, all of which are home to a diverse array of plants and wildlife. Leopards are the primary draw here ‚Äî Yala is reported to have the world's greatest population of leopards, with one cat per square kilometer. You're also likely to see a variety of other wildlife, such as deer, wild boars, crocodiles, langur and toque monkeys, golden jackals, and sloth bears. 

Udawalawe National Park is a must-see for elephant enthusiasts. This vast reserve is home to about 400 Asian elephants, who wander the reserve's 308 square kilometers (119 square miles) of grassland, scrub jungle, and riverine forest. You're likely to see them near the Udawalawe Reservoir, where they often congregate in groups of up to 100 to drink water.

Minneriya National Park, located in the North Central Province, is one of the island's smaller parks, with an area of slightly over 777 square kilometers (300sqmi). Nonetheless, the fauna is nothing short of stunning here. In the meadows, dry tropical forest, and wetlands, you'll discover deer, purple-faced langur and macaque monkeys, sloth bears, and approximately 20 leopards.

If you are interested in wildlife and hope to visit Sri Lanka, Olanka travels is the best travel agent you can contact on your [Sri Lanka Trips](https://www.olankatravels.com/tours/sri-lanka/).

2) Weight/Comfort - I have looked into some UL but that seems like quite a commitment for a first pack.

Sri Lanka is still a relatively unknown holiday destination for many but has been rated as one of the greatest destinations to visit by various travel organizations. And we couldn't be more in agreement!!

As usual, to assist you in planning your travels, we've compiled a list of the finest locations to visit in Sri Lanka in 2021/2022. These are the sites we believe will be ""must-see destinations"" in the next year, based on our recent travel experiences. Some of our favorite spots to visit, areas we believe are less-visited yet deserving of travelers' attention, may have a noteworthy new lodging option that alone is enough to come, or may feature new activities and meet intriguing locals.

Sri Lanka's tiny size makes it great for a two-week stay ‚Äì ideal for a school vacation ‚Äì and an optimum length of time for the first visit as an introduction to this magnificent tropical island. In [Sri Lanka Trip](https://www.olankatravels.com/tours/sri-lanka/sri-lanka-tour-package-7-days/), visitors can enjoy a variety of activities, including wildlife safaris, abundant coastlines and beaches, tea plantations, and world heritage sites; accommodations ranging from boutique to ultra-luxurious to family-friendly and everything in between; delectable cuisine, and hospitable locals.

Hey,

Between May 22 and august 22 and I have full 4 month time to travel and would love to travel through south america and visit some countries including Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. But am struggling a bit about the decision because of covid. Im german so visa mostly wouldn't be a problem. I speak B2/C1 Spanisch (im living now in spain) and am fully vaccinated and boostered and i accept to spend some money in covid 19 tests to enter in a country. But I'm interested in the situation in the countries itselfs. Is everything open? How strict are the governments? How is the atmosphere in the countries, are the people scared or relaxed i terms of covid? What do you think about the situation in the next months? Will I meet other travelers? I have to decide if I postpone my trip to next year where i just would have 2 month or take this year the opportunity, even though covid limit me maybe a bit.

If south america isn't a option i would spend the time in the US with a longer trip to mexico.

My bf and I love to camp, hike, offroad, paddleboard, and backpack.  Unfortunately, I am getting old and my knees are having severe pain when I backpack due to the extra weight.  I notice it when I hike with a 10-15 lb day pack, but the backpack really bothers me especially when climbing UP.  I went to the doc last year, got injections (lubricant/hyaluronic acid) and was told I had arthritis and chondromalacia.  I have done 2 rounds of physical therapy and I workout 5 days a week doing yoga, my PT exercises for hips, glutes, thigh work, LISS cardio (I no longer do any plyometrics to spare my knees), etc.

Anyway, my knees still crackle and my doctor is really not much help.  I'm not at the point where I need a knee replacement yet, but I miss backpacking and want to find a way to enjoy it again.  Any suggestions?

I recently found a love for backpacking.  Only have gone 4 times so far, but the last time I went I was in horrible right knee pain on the uphill at the end of the trek.  It was a 7 mile hike but the last mile was out of a canyon and probably only a 15%-20% grade.  Anyway, I was crying by the time I got to the truck.  I had an MRI and they diagnosed me with chondromalacia (sp) and arthritis(in both knees and my right hip, actually).  I feel like it's only a matter of time before I will need joint replacements.

My bf loves to backpack and wants me to join him as much as I can, but after a year of good rehab, one set of lubricant injections, etc I'm still having knee pain and it's keeping me from wanting to put on that pack.  We did a 13 mile hike a few weeks ago that had some tricky grades and bouldering, etc and my knee did OK but it's the weight of the backpack that really adds to the stress on my joints.

Any suggestions or anecdotal stories you all could share?  I know the reality is that i might just have to learn to love the camping with day hikes and give up the backpacking, but it's something I've come to truly enjoy and it makes me sad to just give it up.",0.094,0.77,0.136,0.9354,1413,288,29,12

I have been having some issues with my backpack rubbing, causing sores, and some bruising on the skin around my iliac crests and was hoping I could get a bit of help. I bought a 50L Osprey Atmos probably five or six months ago which I really like and it's been very comfortable on some of the longer trips I've done other than the hips so I would like to try to figure something out before I look at exchanging it. I've tried a couple different things to try and help it, loosening or tightening the belt, adjusting the torso height, and adjusting the shoulder straps. The last backpacking trip I went on it was so bad I just had to stuff my wool socks I use for sleeping in-between the pack and my hips to get some relief, I later figured out I had the torso height a bit off but that's not all of it. I am a very slim and bony person so I believe that's mostly why but I just can't seem to get it to sit just right, I've had it sitting okay before but never perfect. Other than replacing the backpack with a different one are there any tips that might help me getting it fitting a little better? I feel fairly certain I have most-everything pretty much where it should be and the hip belt is as tight as it needs to be but I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do with packing techniques, clothing choices, or anything else that might allow it to sit a little better.

Colombia looks incredible, good deals on flights atm, and I've never been to SA. Also hear the backpacker scene is pretty thriving and it would be nice to go somewhere it's easy to meet people. Only thing I wanted to really check on is whether it's safe for a 22yr old girl by herself? 

I've got a fair amount of solo travel experience (4months in China/SEA) when I was 18/19, and a trip to Taiwan since then, so I know how to be sensible and due to time constraints I'd probs not be going massively off the beaten track. Still, would be good to hear from people (particularly other women) who've been recently.

Also would be glad for tips on where to visit with Colombia? And also any insight into the Covid situation? üòä

backpacking,1642042256,"One month backpacking through Europe This summer(June 2022) I am planning my first backpacking trip through Europe with my friend in Denmark and I have a lot of questions‚Ä¶.

Background: I am planning a one month trip where I will be staying in hostels. I would like to visit Denmark, Netherlands(Amsterdam), France(Paris), UK(London), Scotland, Whales. I know it‚Äôs a lot but I am also interested in Germany(Berlin), Hungary(Budapest), Austria(Vienna), Switzerland(Zurich), Norway, Sweden and Finland. 

1. Budget
I was thinking of having a budget of around $2000-$3000, is this doable. I would like to keep it cheaper but I am not going to miss out on any activities that I really want to do. 

2. Eurail
I am planning on getting a eurail pass. Is this worth it and if so which pass do you think will suit my needs. I am a ‚Äújunior‚Äù and was looking at the 22 days in 1 month pass. Also can anyone explain how the pass works as it is a bit confusing. Is first class really worth it? 

3. Itinerary 
So I am interested in a lot of places and know I can‚Äôt do all. What places would you recommend. As well as activities in those places. Like besides the Eiffel Tower, louvre, and the Harry Potter studio tour, I haven‚Äôt really planned out any other activities just yet. 

4. Safety
As a girl in her early 20s I am a bit worried about safety. Any tips/advice or anything I should look out for?

5. Packing
I am going to try my best packing light but any general tips?

6. Bag

backpacking,1642035835,"Recommendations for beginner 2-night backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevadas Hey folks - 
Some friends and I (4 total) are looking for a good first-time backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevadas, somewhere between SF and LA, sometime in June. Now, we are total beginners when it comes to backpacking, but we have decent camping experience between us. So we are ideally looking for something relatively light for a three-day, two-night trip that's not too taxing in terms of elevation or distance. We don't mind some serious climbs, but prefer something not at elevation, since we are coast dwellers.

Some basic criteria:

- Yosemite, Sequoia, or environs
- 15-25 miles
- Loop or out-and-back
- Not too high up (10,000 feet max I'm thinking)
- Relatively easy to navigate
- Not too strenuous

Initially, I was stoked for the Mineral King loop in Sequoia, but ruled it out due to elevation and those monster climbs. Doesn't seem like a good option for the first time out :)

backpacking,1641930225,"Summer 2022 backpacking/fly fishing trip recommendations (US Rockies) Hi all,

I am in the midst of researching where to go next year for a backpacking trip with a friend of mine. Since we are both living in the Midwest US with small and young families, we only get to go to the Rockies once or twice a year (that is until the kids get bigger and can handle doing backcountry trips!). We both are ‚Äúrelatively‚Äù ultralight with our gear and in our mid-30s and in pretty good shape. I was able to get my base weight down to about 16 lbs including the fly fishing gear. Which means we definitely like to cover a reasonable amount of ground when we go. Here are some of the criteria I‚Äôm using to search:

-within a 5 hour drive of Denver international airport 

-3 or 4 day loop

Also, im aware that due to the added costs of PCR tests entering other countries that I'm gonna have to be extra clever with money.

Does anyone have any advice? Happy to write off costa rica and head straight to nicaragua or guatemala where I will get more bang for my buck. Ideally I would like to see 2 of guatemala/nicaragua/mexico/costa rica.

Where are the best places to cross over borders domestically in terms of cheap bus fares and antigen tests, any ideas for cheap shoe string travel activities and destinations?

Firstly trigger warning and/or an apology - I use the word fat to describe myself.

I am thinking about taking a trip and living out of my car maybe up to a couple times this year. I'd like to keep in my car a daypack that can keep me up to an entire day on a wilderness trail. So I'm thinking up to 2-3 actual meals, maybe a stove. If I'm going that far, I generally like to carry an emergency camp set up, that is if I get really lost or just end up going way slower than I think, I would have a headlamp, maybe a bivy and a sleeping bag.

So thinking like...maybe 15-20lbs max, for a really sturdy day hike.

I have a Oprey Atmos 65L backpack, which I love, and I have large belt for it, and it works great for me as a bigger guy. But it's pretty serious. It weighs almost 6lbs by itself and it's very bulky. Fantastic for carrying like 40 lbs, but I was hoping to fly lighter than that for dayhiking.

The real kicker about being a fat dude is that if I'm wearing a waist belt at all at my natural waistline, I got a big ol' gut in the way, which means the average waistbelt of your average pack isn't going to fit. Like for almost any fully built-in packs, that waistbelt just isn't actually going to hug my hips, and may not even close around my tummy.

Anyone here have any suggestions of a pack that may work for what I'm looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

The top things I look for in a hostel are...

1. Cleanliness- I'm not a neat freak, but just want to make sure it's a generally clean place!
2. Social Atmosphere- I love when hostels encourage socializing through group outings, classes, recreation rooms, etc! The best part about hostels are the friends you make and experiences you share!
3. Positive Community Impact- I want to make sure that as a traveler I am having a positive impact on the local community. Hostels that employ locals, pay fair wages, and give back to the community they are in are awesome!
4. Unique Features- While not necessarily a make-or-break, unique features totally add to the experience! Does it have a pool, dance classes, ping pong? Anything that makes it stand out or adds to the fun!
5. Great Location- Location is super important! Whether its in the city-center or the rainforest, the right or wrong location can make your stay!
6. Private Rooms- I love the social aspect of hostels, but also value privacy as I will be traveling with my partner. Affordable private rooms are a big plus!

&amp;#x200B;

I have backpacked through Europe and some of my favorite hostels there are...

1. Balmer's (Interlaken)- Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and made some friends!
2. St. Christopher's Inn (Paris)- nice dorm rooms, free &amp; tasty breakfast, and hair dryers!
3. Hola Hostel (Barcelona)- clean bathrooms, awesome staff, and great breakfast!

I haven't even seen it written anywhere on the Mobility Pass site that it is only valid for 45 days, but I've read that repeatedly online. I recently sent in a validation request for my booster dose (I sent this today), so I'm hoping that once it is validated, it will update my date of approval and I will be okay on the 45 day policy that apparently exists. I then tried to scan my mobility pass to be sure it worked, but it said it is not valid because I haven't filled on the C19 form. However, the C19 form says that the affidavit should only be filled out within max 48 hours from arrival. Can someone please help explain if I'm set for the trip or not?

I am a faily experienced hiker with a few mid-long thru hikes under my belt, and I use trail runners and hiking poles. I never used crampons. 

I wanted to hike the eagle creek trail in Columbia Gorge, Oregon yesterday but the path seemed too trecharous and unsafe for my skill and gear, so instead of calling the day off, I heeded the advice of local hikers I met and combined some hikes from Multnomah to Wahkeena including some extensions on top. The path was snowy and icy in many parts, but by avoiding the icy parts and working with my hiking pole it was OK, but now I want 2 things:

1. Buy crampons. I ja e a REI store nearby and will ask for their advice, but prefer to have some knowledge beforehand
2. If weather improves in the coming days, I want to try the eagle creek trail again, with crampons or find other nice hikes within reasonable distance

Does anyone here have experience or advice regarding crampons on trail runners and some general recommendations on day hikes within roughly a 1 hour drive from Portland, Oregon considering the above?

I think something like 20 miles a day is a good measure of what I'm after, but I'm not rigid about this number :-)",0.014,0.856,0.131,0.9731,1222,221,31,8

backpacking,1641482960,"Why all the ultralight bashing? Some common UL myths debunked. (Wall-o-Text warning) For anyone that is unfamiliar with ultralight backpacking (UL), it's a type of wilderness backpacking that emphasizes packing as light a load as possible while still being safe in the outdoors.  An outdated definition of UL used to be a base pack weight under 10lbs, but most modern ULers reject this in favor of packing the proper kit for a given trip, but focusing on getting it as light as possible while still being safe.  But in general for 3 season use, most ULers tend to be between 6-12lbs BPW.

I've noticed that here and in other outdoor subs that us ultralighters at times get shade thrown our way.  There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about UL, so I thought I'd start a discussing to clear things up and have a positive start to the new year.  I'm a reg over at /r/ultralight of course, and have been UL for over a decade now.  But I've been backpacking and an outdoor enthusiast for about 25 years now.  Here's my 3 season gear list: [https://lighterpack.com/r/1ewzt3](https://lighterpack.com/r/1ewzt3). Feel free to ask me questions on my kit.

And before anyone asks for examples, [here's a recent one](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/rvdvnk/ultralights_are_going_to_come_after_me_but_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  No, ULers are not going to come after you.  I've never seen a reg from the UL sub come after anyone.  I have seen trolls give less than constructive criticisms of heavy haulers or inexperienced backpackers, but I don't think it's fair to blame ULers for all that.  What I have seen is ULers give advice when people ask for it, and more often than not in a polite, constructive way too.  You can see this happen in the above example.  Are there some rude ULers?  Yes, but no more than any other outdoor communities.

[Here's another example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/rn46nq/current_state_of_the_gear/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) of UL shade from another outdoor sub for good measure.  

ULers: ...

Top comment in the post: "" Prepare for people to absolutely lose their mind over the amount of weight you're carrying.""

OP: "" Ultralighters weep in shame""

ULers: ???

I could go on, trust me.  I've been on Reddit for like 8 years now, and UL bashing/misconceptions have come up like clockwork every year.

But now let me clear up some misconceptions about UL:

*""UL is expensive!""*

In the UL sub you can find various affordable gear lists in the sidebar.  Several well known UL Youtubers have done videos on this subject.  [Here's a good one](https://youtu.be/fI1qKwPdihg).  Point is, UL does not have to be expensive.  When I first got into UL I was earning a much lower income, and I made my own pack for cheap, slept under a plastic DIY tarp, and used an affordable synthetic sleeping bag for a few years.  And if you look at my gear list today, my tarp/bivy shelter system all in cost me about 250 USD.  That's cheaper than a lot of big brand tents on the market.  And I've had my shelter for several years and it's served me really well, and I plan on continuing to put it to good use in the future.

Of course UL can be expensive.  So can traditional or other types of backpacking.  I've seen bushcraft packs that cost over 500 USD.

*""UL isn't safe!""*

I challenge anyone to find a well known ULer or a reg UL on our forum that has an unsafe kit.  I and all the ULers I know pack a first aid kit and other health and safety gear we need to survive.  And before anyone says that our minimalist FAKs are not enough, here's another challenge for you: find me just one example of an UL backpacker that died on the trail because they didn't have an adequate FAK.  

Are there ULers that don't carry an FAK or have an inadequate FAK?  Yeah, sure.  There are idiots in every community.  But if anyone posts a gear shakedown on the UL sub without an FAK, they will be told to pack one.  We even have a term for such mistakes: stupid light.  But the majority of ULers I've seen over the years are simply not stupid light.

The truth of the matter is, there are a lot of misconceptions in general about what is and is not dangerous out in the wilderness.  Bears are simply not a common cause of death when you crunch the numbers.  You're welcome to look at the numbers for yourself on the actual causes of death out there, in [this source that compiles data on deaths](https://outforia.com/danger-parks/) from 2010-2020 in US national parks.  The number one cause of death is falls.  Wildlife and homicide deaths are very rare.  This is why the grand majority of ULers won't take firearms or big knives/other weapons to protect themselves--there just isn't a meaningful point.  But the majority of ULers in the US will take bear spray in bear country. 

I live in Sweden and have hiked in various wilderness here that are very isolated and have bears, wolves, wolverines, lynx, boars, moose, etc.  And yes I have done quite a bit of off trail hiking in addition to marked trails.  Never been attacked, never needed a gun, and never took one.  I don't even take bear spray--no one does here in Sweden, and I've never seen anyone on trail with a firearm here either.  And bear attacks and homicides are even more rare here than in the US.

*""Ultralight isn't durable!""*

Tell that to the many ULers that have done thru-hikes, literally using their gear every day and night for months on end.  Same as with cost: yes, some UL gear is more delicate than some heavy gear.  But this is not always the case.  And lots of UL gear is VERY durable.  Many ULers have titanium pots, for example.  My backpack is made of 210D ripstop nylon, which is very tough stuff.  As I mentioned before, I do off trail hiking as well, and the woods here in Sweden are pretty thick.  I've never had any of my gear or clothing get severely damaged.  Sure, I've gotten a few small holes and normal wear and tear.  I've had exactly one UL air mat get a hole in it over the past decade, and I was able to easily patch it up.  But plenty of heavy, so-called ""durable"" gear that other people use gets dinged up with use too.

I hope I've been able to clear some things up.  Maybe there are a few rich but dumb ULers out there that only carry the most expensive super-light but super-fragile gear and don't pack a FAK or a water filter.  But they are the very rare exception, and I've never met any IRL or in the UL sub.

Thanks for coming to my UL Ted Talk.  Happy new year and I wish everyone happy and safe hiking in 2022!",0.086,0.791,0.124,0.9934,6599,1182,238,86

My goal is to become a more than proficient backpacker in all types of conditions/seasons and to be involved somehow in outdoor education. 

I‚Äôve read some conflicting opinions about First Aid vs. First Responder courses.

Another person pointed out that obtaining a WFR cert is not as beneficial without having plenty of experience under your belt to make sense of scenarios, or an applicable job.

The goal with a WFR would also be to get a job related to guiding, even if being an actual guide is not in the cards. I could search for a company who might sponsor it, but I think the WFR will give me an upper hand in the application process since I have minimal experience. Is that unfounded?

I‚Äôve been looking for a few weeks since the holidays but finding mostly one far end to the other. 

I have done many hikes and both of us are physically capable of what I believe would be a moderate distance. We plan to put in some miles leading up as well. 

It‚Äôs been some years but I backpacked down to Havasu Falls and back up which I believe was 12 miles or so down into the canyon, camped and then back up two days later. The Havasupai trails are currently closed and have become very difficult to book due to social media popularity. That‚Äôs an almost impossible to beat trip given the views and several falls IMO (look it up if you‚Äôre unfamiliar) but would be happy to do it again. I‚Äôm just afraid we won‚Äôt be able to book it.

backpacking,1641229043,"Looking to get advice on my sleep system for Texas winters (high teens/low 20s, but can vary drastically night to night). 
Hey y'all! I'm new to winter backpacking, get hot easily while I'm sleeping, and am trying to build a sleep system that can be a little flexible during Texas winters. They don't get extremely cold (cold nights would usually be in the high teens or low 20s), but they can vary drastically on a daily basis. A few nights ago it was 60 and the next night was 21 hah.

I just bought a Kelty Cosmic Down 40 bag and own a S2S reactor liner. The thing I'm unsure about is I know most bags are rated while using a pad with an R5.2 pad, and my only pad is a Nemo Switchback (R2). Do you think this could handle the low 20s on it's own? Should I get a new pad or double it up with something?

Im trying to avoid dropping too much money on cold weather gear when it won't get used most of the year. But I also don't want to be unsafe or stupid :)",0.088,0.866,0.046,-0.8006,958,189,27,11

backpacking,1641219664,"Why don't more backpackers carry knives/know about outdoors skills or fire making? Hey everyone, im new here and this might be a dumb question. But I'm always surprised with how little knowledge a lot of backpackers seem to have about basic outdoors stuff like making a fire with a ferro rod or even just knives. As an example, I was watching Dan Becker on YouTube and he said that something you may want to bring backpacking is a decent knife -- then he pulled out a bear grylls survival knife. I was really surprised that a seemingly knowledgeable, respected guy who uses lots of top end gear would be using such a tacky and simply bad knife. A mora is a similar/cheaper price and leagues better. Also, many backpacking youtubers have tutorials on stuff like setting up a tent or packing your backpack well but not on how to make a fire in the woods for example. This may just be a question for me as someone who does backpacking and bushcraft, but I assumed that with spending so much time in the outdoors, more backpackers would have greater outdoors knowledge rather than only knowledge on how to pack lightly, maintain a good hiking pace, etc. Sometimes it feels like im being encouraged to just kind of walk through and take a quick look around at nature and not really get into the forest itself. I saw someone say that backpacking is more like being a spectator in nature and bushcraft is more like being a participant in it, and i want to know if you all think thats true. Not trying to be disrespectful at all, just curious! I think the skills most backpackers know (ie pack weight, how to hike efficiently, etc) are very important as well, I just am curious why they don't seem to know many outdoors skills.

This was expensive and I probably wore it less than a dozen times in the years I owned it.   Over a dozen nickel/quarter-sized holes.

backpacking,1641048132,"Backpack solution for one month solotravel in urban setting? Hello, fellow travelers!

I will be going for my first long solo trip as soon as covid restrictions allow it. Now that I am in the phase of planning, I have to decide what gear I will be using and I need some advice from more experienced solo travelers.

The destination where I am going is Japan, and the stay is 4 weeks. As you probably know, Japan is quite packed with its high population density and tight urban spaces. I also will be using the public transport alot and will be walking long distances during my trip. Now my question is, what kind of solution would be recommended? Or at least what are their pros and cons?

I've been thinking of getting a 'backpack system' that is a combination of a bigger pack and a daypack. Now my initial idea was to use the combo between accomodations, and then use the daypack during sightseeing leaving the bigger pack to the place I'm staying. The problem with this is that it could perhaps be somewhat limiting when between cities..? And maybe at times I can not find a safe place to store the bigger one..?

Could a smaller backpack (20-30l) be doable for 4 weeks of travel? I mean doing the laundry could be a fuss and not having any extra space might be a problem. A ~40l backpack also feels tempting, but is it necessary/worth it? 

Thanks in advance.",0.023,0.93,0.047,0.7049,1364,245,26,17

I recently planned a trip (solo initially), and was talking to a friend about it. She was interested in coming, so I agreed. Then she wanted her husband to come because she was  nervous about her first excursion of any kind (this was a multi-day backpacking trip in cabins). After that passed, she wanted to invite a complete stranger, that I had to say no to with the reasons that I don't know this person, we might have different travel styles, and I wanted to enjoy the trip and not get stuck with someone that could cause problems (the other woman had a lot of experience on this trail, I just didn't want to have a stranger on a trip I was planning solo). Ultimately, she backed out of the trip altogether. I would like to know if anyone has guidance for how to have these conversations AHEAD of time, and if there are specific questions you ask.

1. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: for breakfast, a simple ""b√°nh m√¨ ·ªëp la"" (baguette + sunny side up eggs + pickle + simple soya sauce/ chilly sauce + cucumber). It usually costs 20,000 VND (1 USD) at a normal local food stall. You can find this almost everywhere in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
2. Gothenburg, Sweden: lunch is the best way for you to explore local food at a good price. Almost every restaurants in Gothenburg have a lunch menu where you can get some of the same dishes in their A La cart menu at half price. The price for a lunch in Gothenburg is around 10 - 12 USD.

Even if anyone has just come back from going around or is planning on going sometime in 2022? I've read about a trail called the banana pancake trail which involves a few countries but I believe most of them still aren't allowing travellers to enter the country, I've seen Thailands new scheme to get people into the country but I don't know if its enough to plan to leave everything behind and plan to go out there, to just find most places deserted/lack of other backpackers like myself! Id be solo travelling so I want to meet people that are backpacking too, I just worry everyone is holding off going travelling until restrictions are eased around these countries and the tourism sector is still largely shut over there.

backpacking,1640752000,"Sharing a stupid mistake I made this year. Last October I went on my first ever solo backpacking trip. 5 days/4 nights. The very first day was amazing, I hiked about 13 miles. Since it was October It got dark a little after 6 pm. I continued on for about 2-3 miles miles night hiking. I still had a ways to go to where I wanted to camp for the night but it was just too dark and I was very tired at that point. I found a spot set up my tent, threw almost all of my gear into the tent along with my jacket because even though it was cold I built up a sweat from all the hiking. Last thing I had to do was hang my bear bag some where from a tree. I take that and just my flash light and go walking down the trail to find a good spot. I walk back and forth both directions looking for a good enough branch but for whatever reason I just can‚Äôt. I go a little further down the trail and I start walking into the woods thinking I may have found an ok spot, turns out it was not that great. I start to head back to the trail and after walking for a minute I realize I can‚Äôt find it! It was pitch black outside and since it was fall the leaves were covering every. I start wandering around in circles probably 20 minutes trying to find the trail so I can get back to the safety and warmth of my tent, and on top of that I notice my flash light is starting to get dimmer from all the continued use. At this point it starts crossing my mind I‚Äôm going to freeze to death in the darkness. 

What saved me was stopping, calming down, and thinking. I was then able to hear the faint sound of a creek. I remembered earlier when I was going back and forth that there was a small wooden bridge going over a creek. I figured my best chance was getting to the creek and walking along side it in ether direction till I found the bridge/trail. 

My plan worked and I made it safely back to my tent. I was so embarrassed that I did something dumb like that to put myself in that sort of situation, I didn‚Äôt tell any one about it for a couple weeks. I just wanted to share the story now and maybe help prevent someone else from making the same mistakes. Thanks for reading.",0.076,0.79,0.134,0.9758,2150,434,46,24

backpacking,1640634306,"Free Trade Agreement 417 Australia UK - Am I eligible? I've already ""completed"" a 1st year 417 visa So my story:  


I visited Australia for 1 year from May 2018 to May 2019. During this time I worked my ass off on the farms, did my 88 days, subsequently got screwed over with payslips and pay (classic Oz experience lol).

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of the gruelling, death defying time I spent working on cattle stations and out at sea, I fell in love with Australia, and planned to seek PR status with devoting my 2nd year solely to seeking out a company that would sponsor me to say in my desired field of work (at which point I found out about the payslip situation - I've spent the last 2 years in Canada where I've obtained my PR but I still want to go back to Australia and trying to hatch a plan).

My query:

My general query is concerning the said changes coming with the Free Trade Agreement, where I see UK citizens can stay up to 3 years in Australia without the previously mandatory farmwork... Does anyone know if I will still be eligible to apply for my 2nd year visa with this change, or because I have already ""completed"" my 417 sponsorship, am I not eligible? 

I'm seriously hoping with all my heart and soul I can apply for a 2nd year, just without the requirement.

If I'm not eligible, it seems there is a big grey area for UK citizens individual's that are currently on a 417 and in Australia... Do they have to do the required farmwork? Seems a little unfair for individuals that can just turn up on the right day and not have to do it at all?

I've scoured the internet, reached out to immigration agents, and so far only one has replied suggesting I wouldn't be eligible, but they weren't certain... But again, where does this leave those who will be in the country when the changes apply? Or those that have left Australia within there 1st year visa duration, but still have an active visa? Or people such as myself, that have completed a 1st year, but for whatever reason haven't been eligible for the 88 days, but do wish to stay/return for a 2nd/3rd year?

If no-one has any answers, just a pointer in the right direction to be able to find out this information as it comes available would be super handy!

For the last several months, I've had discomfort in my right leg, starting from right under my rear end and continuing down the back of my leg to my knee. The discomfort is such that for a bit I thought my knee was the injury. Most of the time, this ""injury"" doesn't bother me much at all. I can feel it, but I still have full mobility and strength. When I run, well, I run completely fine and normally, until I stop. Any kind of stop (usually 30 seconds at a stoplight), and when I start running again, I can barely extend the leg forward. After a few (5-10) limpy strides and I am back to running normally. After a long run, I get a bit achy, but that's kind've it. 

My household got hit by COVID recently, so I spent a couple weeks not running, and it's not made the leg feel any different. If I work it hard, it doesn't get worse. It just stays irksome. 

I'm not looking necessarily for treatment recommendations here, but has anyone experienced such a static, persistent, similar injury, and if so, what was it? I'm happy to talk to my doctor about it, but I don't even know what to suggest might be going on. Persistent muscle stiffness?

ultrarunning,1645859234,"Total volume vs LRs for 100K training Hi gang,

Got my first 100K coming up in April! Feeling pretty prepared with 3,000 miles in the book in 2021 and even slightly more than that (average) so far in 2022. In that stretch I've done four 50K's, one six-hour (41 miles, lifetime longest), and a handful of other road and trail marathons.

I'm trying to hone down these last eight weeks going into that 100K. Compared to overall volume I feel I'm a little short on LRs -- I've done runs of 31, 28, and 20 this year, but also have lots of weeks where I might hit low 60's in mileage but not get a single run over a HM. I have been at least a little mindful of trying back-to-back work, with a 28-12 double and a 31-14 (last week, that one hurt and knocked me into an easy \`\~50 mile week now :P).

How much would you prioritize more 20's or 30's in these last few weeks? And how far out from 100K day should the last ones be? My race is April 23 -- our spring break week (kindergarten teacher) is March 21-27, which would be a nice convenient way to get a last big burst of mileage in before beginning to ease up and taper.

FYI, the race is mostly paved, some dirt/gravel. One 1000' climb, a couple others half that size, some rolling.

ultrarunning,1645604323,"Advice for an (overly?) ambitious beginner Hi to all, sorry for the long post :) But I need some advice and context is probably important. 

First let's start with a bit of background. I'm an overweight tall man (120kg/194cm - 265/6'4). Last year I got into the idea of running. Started on my own and got to a point where I could run about 8k without dying. Seeing that progress can be made, I gave myself an ambitious goal of running a marathon by the end of the year. That was around March, the marathon was at the end of October. I got a training plan from [RunnersConnect.com](https://RunnersConnect.com) and started following it almost religiously. I made a lot of progress by mid-late August but by then it seems I have overtrained myself basically and developed Achilles tendonitis in both my legs. That derailed that plan completely. All I had from racing was a 10k in mid-August.   
During that time I fell into a rabbit hole of ultra trail running on Youtube and found it very much to my liking. The issue I had with road running was also that in order to train on any semblance of a flat course I had to take a 20 min drive but I have basically unlimited trails when I step out of my house. It is also much less mind-numbing but I digress.   
So after 4,5 months off the running wagon, I started back slowly with longer walks and hikes in January. Now I'm slowly building back to running on the flats and walking/hiking the climbs. This amounts to about 4 hours on legs per week at this point. I've mostly been going by feel and/or heart rate, making sure to keep the effort low to build up my base. I've also been doing overall strength work in the gym. I also try to do some cross-training with my e-bike with the same low effort in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the interesting part. I've been thinking of setting a very ambitious goal of completing an ultra this year. I have my sights set on a 65k in early November. I believe that this could be achievable. Of course, the one and only goal is to finish the race. It has a 17h cutoff. My overall plan would be something like: 

* Running 
* Set up a run schedule that is time based, that starts at the current level and adds 10-15% weekly time each month
* Keep most of the effort low to build the base and resistance, sprinkle a bit of speed/hill/tempo work perhaps every two weeks or so to minimize the strain on the Achilles and I also don't like it :)

Cross-training

*  Keep the e-bike rides to complement the training or if the situation comes up, supplement the runs 
* Keep up with the strength training 2-4 times a week 

Races and goals

* 12k end of April
* 30k early May
* 10k early June (road)
* 21k mid-June
* 10k early August
* 30k mid-September
* 30k late September
* 65k early November

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the questions :) 

1. Am I mad in general?
2. Is the 65k a plausible goal? 
3. Does the ""training"" plan make sense in general? Would there be a better way to go about it? 
4. Does the race calendar make sense? (The 30k in May seems quite ambitious but I really like the race and would love to go) 
5. Any other comments? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your input in advance. I'm really excited about this already but I also need to know if I just set myself up to fail or if I'm missing something etc. I'm sure that all the experience this subreddit has will provide a lot of useful info to me. 

Also, I would love to hear if there are any bigger guys out there about their experience in general. I think that some things can be missed by ""normal"" runners.

* Barkley's claim of 12000' in 26 miles, works out to 461 feet of gain per mile. The Rut 50k in Big Sky, considered one of the hilliest races in the country, takes place on the grounds of a montana ski resort and still only gets to 10500' in 31 miles (338' of gain per mile). The Hard Rock 100 goes through the San Juan mountains of Colorado, but its 33k of gain only works out to 330' per mile. That would make Barkley 1.5 times hillier than courses that are renowned for their hilliness. I'm not even saying it's less hilly than those races - just that I don't think it's possible to go contrive a race course that steep in TN.

* Elevation gain is a tricky thing to calculate. It's sensitive both to the quality of the elevation data and to the method used to calculate it. If there is a lot of noise in the elevation data, you'll be counting micro-climbs that don't really exist. I've worked with elevation data on my own runs and hikes, and I've had to accept the reality that elevation data noise can easily add more than 10% to the calculated elevation gain of my hike.

This is not meant to be a potshot at barkley. I just think about elevation gain a lot in my own training, and the claim made me skeptical.

Back story: I caught COVID in early January and took about 10 days to get back to 100%. Directly after recovering I did a half marathon and felt great until I tripped over a root and pulled my hip flexor around mile 10 which added excess pain/stress to finish the race. I took one day off then got back to training hard but went easy on my legs. 3 days after the half marathon I met up with a group of people training under a coach, and against my better judgment I did a 3 mile for time with them. I‚Äôve never had a run more painful. I pretty much kept my normal pace but my average heart rate was 198 and it topped out at 210. I collapsed at the end and my body was done. After that I took 5 days off and got back into training (light weights, cals and swims) and felt fine for a week but at the end of the week I did a ruck and woke up with that same fatigue. Ever since then my body hasn‚Äôt been able to perform. I‚Äôve take a combined 10 rest days the past 3 weeks and I can‚Äôt seem to recover. I‚Äôve done an easy 5k once a week the past 2 weeks and each time has left my legs dead for days. My energy levels are perfectly normal. Symptoms I‚Äôve had are: soreness in the palms of my hands and soles of my feet, muscle spasms to different muscle groups all throughout the day, and a bruised like feeling (not soreness) in my quads after the 5k‚Äôs.

ultrarunning,1645069627,"Collected Pieces of Unsolicited Advice Hey all, a few weeks ago I wrote up a [tough love](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/shnj8k/the_best_way_to_prepare_for_an_ultra_is_to_train/) piece on why you should be training consistently. I wanted to expand on that, and go over some of the pillars I associate with strong runners. Just a disclaimer, I'm not a pro or a coach and all of this comes from my own experience, don't take it as gospel

First and foremost, all the pieces of your training are interconnected. Every run you do, every meal you eat, and every training decision you make feed into a self-reinforcing cycle. That cycle can be productive or destructive, it all depends on what you put into it. So I'm going to focus on some of the pieces I've found most helpful.

1. Adding two 20 minute sessions of weightlifting into your weekly schedule is a super easy way to get faster and more resilient. When I think of what makes a strong runner, I like to use a car as an analogy. You've got the engine, which has to be powerful and efficient to get you moving, and the chassis, which has to be strong enough to support all the power coming out of the engine. Weightlifting improves your engine and chassis all at the same time. [You can get a decent session done in 8 minutes, ](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/8-minute-speed-legs) and you don't need expensive equipment. If you enjoy this stuff, you can supplement with [plyometrics](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20783990/improve-running-economy-with-plyometrics/) and [bodyweight excercises](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/best-bodyweight-workout-runners/)  Weightlifting is free gains, take them.

2. If you only train slow, you'll race slow. I think one of the biggest misconceptions among ultrarunners is that because our racing distances are longer we don't need Speedwork. But being able to run fast comfortably is essential if you want a smooth racing pace. Speedwork is an essential part of building running economy, which is essentially the amount of work it takes for you to run a certain pace. Super fast runners have extremely strong engines, but they're also *economical*, it takes them less effort to run the same pace as you because they're all around more efficient. Speed work doesn't have to be gut wrenching or over-frequent, 1 workout a week is enough to start building speed. I'd focus on shorter intervals, (8x (1 fast/1 easy, 2 fast/2 easy ect.)) but this is an area where you should feel free to explore different workouts and do what you enjoy! You can also add some strides (20 second sprints, focusing on good form) into your easy runs to get some extra Speedwork in. As you develop this

3. In running, consistency is everything. There can be real physical consequences to training for and running races without a solid baseline of fitness. I've seen many athletes roll through a cycle of under-training for months, compensating by over-training with a couple of big weeks, barely crossing the finish line, then getting right back down to 10mpw until they want to race something again. Almost invariably these people develop chronic injuries or over-training syndrome, and drop out of the sport for months to years at a time while they recover.

 If you want to run an ultra, get faster, or even just run injury-free   you need to build up a consistent base of mileage. The longer you've been running and the fitter you are, the more you can get away with. But for most of us mortals that means running at least 20-30 miles a week as a baseline. You want to get faster? Get injured less often? Get a training plan, a book, or a coach and run consistently for a couple of years.

4. Diet matters. This one cuts both ways, weighing less is going to make you faster up to a point but trying to cut weight during training is risky. Sustained caloric deficits are stressful on your body, and when you combine them with hard high mileage weeks you have a recipe for over training and injury. Like we noted before, in running consistency is everything. Losing a little more weight a little faster isn't worth it if you're risking the consistency you've spent years building up. 

 As someone who dropped 20 pounds over 2 years and noticed a real difference in my speed, my only suggestion would be to focus on eating more fruits and vegetables. For me, approaching weight loss in terms of cutting OUT food does not work. I undereat, can't sleep, and have chronic fatigue issues. Focusing on eating more vegetables and fruits helps me fill my plate up with volume, while still enjoying all the carbs that help make me faster. Really important to note that diet and weight are super personal, and what works for other folks might not work for you. If you want to lose some weight I would encourage you to try a lot of different things, be super forgiving of yourself, and not worry about it too much. Ultimately none of us are professionals and running should be about having *fun*. If cutting weight is stressing you out, forget about it entirely. 

5. Everything else helps on the margin, so do what works for you. There are hundreds of thousands of you-tubers claiming to have the stretching routine, bodyweight exercise, ice-recovery foamgun that'll totally revolutionize your training. The harsh reality is that a lot of the science behind this stuff is murky at best. That's not to say they don't work, its just not clear that they 100% do. My only advice here would be to try lots of things, and incorporate the ones that make you feel stronger and more confident. Different stuff probably works for different people, so don't feel like you *have* to do anything to train well. 

6. Have fun! This is the most obvious, boring point, but even if your focus is on being the fastest strongest runner possible, you should always do it with an eye on your own personal enjoyment. Being the best runner you can be is a lifelong endeavor, no one training cycle will make or break your potential. If you're feeling run down, take a day off. If you're in a slump and you're not enjoying running at all, take a week or even a month off. Ride a bike, try knitting, play tennis. Frankly, the athletes I know who push through their un-enthusiam for running almost invariably get hurt or just stop running entirely at some point. Maybe they're overtrained, maybe they're just bored, but their body and mind are trying to tell them to take a break. So do that! Above all be easy on yourself, and remember to enjoy the journey!",0.062,0.787,0.151,0.9988,6558,1105,80,74

So I'm 42. Almost 43. I run several ultras each year. I did 2 x 100 miles last 6 months. I do pretty intense training around 70K a week including hill climbs.  I walk the dog 2 hours a day for 10k total which is another 70K each week. During that I throw with balls and sticks, I run up hills with him. So it's actually quite the workout.

I run 2 marathons each year with a PB of around 3:15. Plus I run my fair share of races like a couple of them every month which varies from half road marathons to 20-40K trails up to 160K.

I try to eat healthy. I cook fresh every night and I don't snack too often. I'm doing this for years now. And yes I did lose weight. I went from 95 kg to 82 kg (I'm 1.95m) which is pretty amazing but I'm on a plateau right now where my weight is always the same. And I can't seem to get rid of my love handles and belly fat.

I talked to a guy when I ran MDS and he had the same issue. He was even faster than me.. He was a beast and made like top 50 yet he had the same handles.

Fairly new to running coming from road cycling at a decent level, typically 600km training weeks, 200km+ races etc. 

I decided to get running after taking some time off racing/riding due to our youngest daughter being born and thought it would be a great thing to do with my wife as she has always been a runner. One thing lead to another and I'm totally hooked, I love to suffer and running long distance through the bush sure feeds that beast in me. Currently training for my first 56k race with 3,800 metres of vert but I'm struggling to find shoes that work. Looking to build up to a 100k event sometime next year with a goal of a 100miler maybe 2024.

Unfortuantely I have wide and thick feet through the midfoot. Not really knowing much about running gear I did some reading and grabbed a pair of Hoka Challenger ATR6 but didn't like the stack height or the cushiony ride, they also hurt the arch in my left foot. Decided to go the other extreme and try Altra Superior 4 's and really loved the minimalist feel, but after a 22k run last weekend my achilles and left foot were smashed. I figured as I hadn't built years of running in shoes with drop the transition to zero drop might not be too extreme. 

I recently bought my wife a pair of Salomon Ultra 3's and she loves them. Figured I'd try them myself despite reading they're a narrower fit and yep, there's no chance I'm wearing these so back they go.

Currently looking at Inov-8 G270's, Lone Peak 6's, Cascadia 16's as options. I realise there's differing opinions on zero drop but from what I've read I'm almost feeling limited to Altra clown shoes as even the Superiors are snug across the midfoot.

I'm wondering there's anything along the lines of Salomon Ultra's for my boat feet?

Confused and sick of ordering shoes only to send them back as I live in a regional area and there's not a lot of opportunity to try shoes on.

I've been running about 35 miles/wk on average for the last year but in the last 3 months it's been closer to 45 miles/wk.

I obviously was because I did a PB half marathon, PB 30Km and smashed my time on almost every segment in that race.

My favourite shoes ever are the Inov-8 Terraultras but the recent models have a stupidly thin tongue. The last few ultras I've done in them, I've had pain and a bump on the front of my ankle, caused by the laces digging in. It's restricted my running for 2-3 weeks after.

I also use Lone Peak 5s but I've got a big hole above my big toe after only 500k. I'm questioning their durability. They're also stupidly wide and my foot rotates too much within them when on rocky trails. But they have a decent tongue and have a similar good feel for the ground like the Inov-8s. I could look at going from size 11 to size 10.5 - that's probably the obvious option.

Ideally, I want the following from the Inov-8: zero-drop, low stack height, grippy on anything but loose mud, flexible and good feel for the terrain, durable sole, durable upper. And the following from the Lone Peaks: padded tongue. Any suggestions? I probably need something that's going to protect me from sharp rocks, I guess.

I'm looking at NB Hierros as an outside option, but my main alternatives to getting a size 10.5 LP5 are other Altra shoes. I'm not sure which? What's the difference between LP, Olympus, Superior and Timp? Also Adidas Terrex Agravic?

(a) Wear the old ones, since I did most of my training in them, and 320 miles isn't really that much;

This isn't strictly ultra related but I figured this running community uses rucksacks more than most so would have ideas. It's also the most responsive and helpful online running community I know of anyway.

I just got a new OMM Classic 25 to replace my old OMM Classic 25 and while I love it only the waist strap came with an elastic band/strap thing to hold the excess in place. On the chest, shoulder and main bag straps the excess just flutters about when running. I can tie them up or tuck them into side pockets but they tend to shake out, plus it looks ugly and my new bag looks so sleek atm. üòÖAnyone know of any nice solutions for securing the excess strap in place?

Getting some spare elastic strap bands like those on the waist belt would work but I can't find them online (not sure what they're actually called). They tend to lose elasticity within a couple of months so I'd prefer something longer lasting.

ultrarunning,1643694656,"The best way to prepare for an ultra is to train well for several years Ultra's aren't like other road races, there are real risks to cramming training. 50+ miles are hard on the body and there can be real physical consequences to training for and running races without a solid baseline of fitness. I've seen many athletes roll through a cycle of under-training for months, compensating by over-training with a couple of big weeks, barely crossing the finish line, then getting right back down to 10mpw until they want to race something again. Almost invariably these people develop chronic injuries or over-training syndrome, and drop out of the sport for months to years at a time while they recover.

The hard truth of running is that there's only one silver bullet, consistent training. If you want to run an ultra safely you need to build up a consistent base of mileage to build on. The longer you've been running and the fitter you are, the less you can get away with. But for most of us mortals that means running at least 20-30 miles a week as a baseline. You want to get faster? Get injured less often? Get a training plan, a book, or a coach and run consistently for a couple of years.",0.055,0.882,0.063,0.186,1196,215,11,11

ultrarunning,1643381091,"Trail shoe vs. boot - 61mile in mud and rain I've got an event coming in April, in the North of England. The distance is 61mile over varied terrain but certainly includes mud and bog as well as some road and trail, conditions are traditionally 'wet'. I did this event some years back as a walker, finishing in just over 23 hours, and I was very much geared up as hiker including full ankle walking boots. I'm now heading back a little older, but much more of a runner, with a view to improve my time (although conditions will dictate as much as gear and training).  


I have been training with the Inov-8 Roclites 370s (v. light boot), they took me some time to get used to but I just about comfortable with them. The main problems were the lack of material meant my feet took most of the impact and they were not at all waterproof, although on this event it doesn't matter much as I'll be up my knees at some point.  And they've now fallen apart anyway. 

For my normal hiking I've got a pair of Scarpa ZG lite GTs, which come in at 600g/pair. They are solid and will support me for the distance I'm sure, but they essentially discount any chance of running. 

I've also got trail shoes Hoka Speedgoats, but I can't believe they will cope. 

So looking for a good middle ground I've come across the the new Roclite 286 GTX, but now I'm worried I'm looking for the 'everything boot' and I will end with a compromise that comprises everything and maybe I should cut the crap and get proper trail runners? 

I know the usual advice is I have to try and see what works for me, but I still need a starting point, and I have limited time (and budget) to be buying shoes and giving them real trials.

So I am an avid runner and this year I told myself that if I PR'd on my January marathon that I would consider running a 50k or 50 mile. I PR'd and so am now looking at some towards the end of the year. The one I am planning to do is an almost entirely flat looped course and from everything I've read about it it is ideal for first-timers (it's the Children of the Cane Run in Louisiana). 

My ""dilemma"" is this. Bottom line is that I KNOW I can finish 30 miles, while it is more than a marathon it is not so much more that I would be worried about not finishing (even if I had to walk the last 4 miles). As someone who has never run an ultra, should I start with 30 and then go to 50 at another point - or should I start my training with looking to do 50. The ultra isn't until the end of October so I am planning to begin my training not too long from now.

My question below actually relate to the marathon distance (and a lofty goal time) but this community is much more active, considerate and informative than any threads on the marathon I can find so hopefully that is ok üòÅ

Before kicking off, I appreciate that all plans and goals are relative to the individual and their circumstances so what works for some might not work for others. 

My key question: _is 45% of weekly mileage too long for the long run?_ 

My interests (and reason for asking re 40%) are:
- longer long runs allows me to run fewer days but achieve a moderate build of total weekly mileage. I only want to run 4 days a week (Sunday on the bike to recover) 
- The last 6 months I've switched from more days, shorter distances to running fewer days but longer runs. My body likes the recovery. 
- I like having time to lift heavy weights but when I ran slow/easy every day, I never felt fresh enough to workout properly. 
- Having trained for 50km ultras the last 2 years (1 was cancelled) I know I can handle the higher distances. I prefer to go faster (less time running, less vert, not carrying as much crap in a vest) so while the stress is more intense (pace), it's also 'less time on feet.' This part I'm weary of as bludging on the trails, stopping, eating, taking photos (lol) is way easier than no breaks, higher HR, faster pace, much faster finishing etc. 

In my draft plan:
- my plan is 22 weeks long (2 week taper incl race week) 
- my highest volume is 80km/week with a 36km longy, 21 days before race day. Not high at all, but not sure I could handle more. 
- plan cycles through 4 weeks (4th week is always recovery ie less volume) 
- there are 5 weeks where longy is 30km or above, but all weeks bar 1 are above 20km (other than rest weeks and taper)

Currently average 50km/week, 1000m of vert, about 20km longy with a fast finish (3-4km at GMP at end of the run). Feel pretty fit but don't want to cook myself!

In 1913, during America‚Äôs earliest mountain trail ultra, Mount Baker Marathon (50k), a runner was lost during the race. While running down a glacier on Mount Baker in Washington, Victor Galbraith, age 32, dressed in scant running clothes, fell into a 40-foot crevasse, and couldn‚Äôt get out. Several hours later, a search party was able to find his footprints, heard his shouts, and hauled him out with a rope.

Galbraith suffered from shock, exposure, bruises, and was carried down on a stretcher. He later said, his first thought was wondering if he could get out. His second thought was disappointment that he was out of the race. The ultra was discontinued for the next 103 years.

I took the next days easy and the pain went away. However, after that happened other things started to pop up here and there. Nothing too significant, but frustrating. Ended up having to miss the R2R2R adventure anyway due to a COVID scare and having to isolate. 

After all of this, I wanted to take some down time and then was unmotivated due to the lack of races around me or at least nothing I wanted to train for.

Start of the topic discussion of my training:
Around beginning of November of 2020 I wanted to start training again. During the summer I had some builds, but never amounting to much. Lets say I was starting from 0. 

Started week 1 with 9 miles total - 3x days at 2 miles total and 1x day with a 3 mile ""long run"". 

Weeks following were: 11 miles, 14 miles, and 10 miles (missed a day due to the booster taking a lot out of me) running 4 days a week still. 

I wanted to focus on running shorter distances, but more frequently in this build up to see if my body recovered better. 

So, at week 5 I started running 5 days a week: 18 miles, 22 miles, 25 miles, and 29 miles total. 

At week 9 I started running 6 days a week with the first being my first big jump in mileage from the previous week (I guess mistake): 36 and then 34. The second week here would have been 40, but on I went to the trails for my long run and they were super muddy, so only did 1x of the 2x 6 mile loops.

Also during this week my left knee started to feel like an injury was popping up. Decided to take 4 days off to rest and recover and then ease back into mileage. Finished off the next week with 13 miles total (4, 3 and 6 mile days). Knee felt okay, added some core and strength work to combat issues, etc... but my aerobic fitness seems to have plummeted in just 4 days. The 3 days of running this week were quite hard. For example, I was running sub 8 min/miles and not feeling too fatigued after my runs. This week running &gt; 9 min/miles and shorter distances my HR is higher than previous weeks and it obviously feels harder too.

Monday is my rest day, so starting this week my first 2 runs were 4 miles and 3 yesterday, but despite running really easy still ~ 9 min/miles, my heart rate and effort was really high. I only planned to run about 26 miles this week to be in between my last week and where my mileage was prior to the 4 days off. 

Everywhere I read on the internet, people say or articles say if you take ~1 week off you should be able to start back where you were (maybe taking it a little easier though). I take 4 days off and I feel like my past 10-12 weeks of building has disappeared/my fitness is gone... Am I going crazy?

Maybe I made a mistake when I jumped up to 6 days a week and went from 5 days of running @ 29 miles total to 6 days of running @ 36 miles total, but really the other parts of my build have been pretty reasonable I feel. 

My knee feels reasonable, no significant issues yet. Going to continue to strength train/foam roll regularly and ice/ibuprofen if necessary. 

I plan to go for a 6 mile run today, taking it super easy again, and assess more after this run. If it is super hard, I am not sure what I am going to do. Would feel terrible if I had to ""restart"" training or take time off... anyway, maybe this is more of a rant than anything else, but what are your experiences when building mileage back from ""zero""... do resources on the internet really help you? 

My final thoughts are, I feel like I am less aggressive in mileage increases than those in many plans on the internet or many advices on the internet, but still have many hiccups when getting back into things.",0.075,0.81,0.115,0.9933,4700,899,98,46

I've been feeling pretty good lately. My current running shoes probably have somewhere around 350 miles. 
On Friday about mile eight into a 10 mile run I noticed a little bit of pain in my shin. 
On Saturday in the beginning of a 17 mile run my left hurt For the first few miles. The pain went away and then came back around mile 12. I finished the run and didn't really notice anything. 
Sunday morning I woke up and my shin honestly hurt to sleep and hurt pretty much if anything touched it. I did not run it got better on Monday but still hurt to walk a little. I attempted to run but got .1 into the run and it was too painful. I took off Tuesday.

What: the TP60. This is the little brother of the Madrid region's number one ultra, the Gran Trail Pe√±alara. This mini-ultra usually comes in a taround 62-65km, with 2500-2800m of vert depending on the route. The race goes over the highest peak in the range at 2428m (Pe√±alara), and has some pretty technical sections including a gnarly ridge. I know most of the route quite well, as I hike and run a lot in the Sierra de Guadarrama. 13 hour cut-off

When: October 9, so only 37 weeks left to prepare!

Who am I? An overweight, overworked 46-year-old. I run slowly. For the last year I have been around the 60-65km/week mark, and it's going to be pretty difficult to get beyond that, for reasons of time. My goal is 'just to finish.' My longest run so far was a 45km, 1800m+ 'Maraton de Monta√±a' (Mountain Marathon events in Spain tend to be anywhere between 40-45km, and to a have 1500m or more vert). I finished but very much at the back of the pack, like 95th out of 100 or something, in 6:57, partly because I started to get awful calf cramps after about 25km.

So what's the plan? That's what I'm here for! At the moment I'm vaguely following a 50km plan, building up to a self-supported, relatively flat/downhill 50km run I have planned for May 2 or 3. I say vaguely because time, family and social commitments, periodic drops in energy levels. i think I'll keep working on that until May even if I do get a place, and then rejig from May. So that will be June, July, August and September to build to the event. I know that I need to do strength work, and lots of hills in training to minimise the likeliehood of getting cramps again.

Should preface that I'm a beginner/slower runner, so not planning to win or anything but hoping for an overall smooth and fun experience. 

I have a salomon adv skin 12 hydration pack and for my longer training runs (18 miles +) I've been using a 1.5 liter bladder + the two bottles in front. 

The race has aid stations/water stops every 7ish miles. My initial thought was to just wear the vest with the 2 bottles (no bladder) and refill fairly often. However, if I do my usual set-up of bladder + bottles, I can probably make it to the last station at mile 20 before I will need to refill (would only refill bottles, definitely not trying to fuss with that bladder out there). 

Basically weighing these 2 options:

1. Bladder + bottles: somewhat heavier to start but will require fewer stops to refill and can just grab snacks and go
2. Only bottles: lighter but will need to stop and refill more often, potentially wait in line/shove bottles back into vest, etc.

Obviously a fairly small and nitpicky question but wondering if others have thoughts or experience they could share.

ultrarunning,1641868937,"R2R2R concern - want opinions So I have a R2R2R trip planned with some running buddies in April.  Been planning/training since late last summer.  Not concerned about making the distance/climb.  What I have figured out recently is that, while I knew I was the slowest of the group, I am a whole lot slower than the rest of the group.  Like 3.5 minutes plus per mile slower.  For reference, in a group run a couple weeks ago I lost sight of them around the first mile and didn‚Äôt see anyone again until they sent someone to find me after they were all done.  

So my question: I‚Äôm thinking of backing out of the group because of the speed/time disparity.  At 3.5 minutes per mile, I‚Äôll be 2.5 hours slower than the rest of the group.  I really don‚Äôt want them all finished ready to go shower, eat, and relax, and having to wait so long on me.  I could care less about being on my own, do most of my long runs in the mountains solo.  

I know if I try and talk with them about it, they will tell me it doesn‚Äôt matter, they‚Äôll support me, etc, but it‚Äôs a lot different now than after they‚Äôve spent 14 hours on the trail.  So I guess I‚Äôm looking for an un-biased opinion on whether being a part of this group is the right choice for this type of trip.

I'm wondering... Does the North Rim closure just mean shops and lodging is unavailable, or is it inaccessible period? I'd plan to drive down with a couple friends and camp at the rim to start the next day, so we don't need lodging or restaurants. Does this seem feasible in late November? 

Secondly (people who've done R2R or R2R2R in late fall) - is there ANY water supply at all, including filling up in the river itself, that late in the year? Or would I need to carry in ALL the water I need for the entire 50 mile day? Would there be water available at the South Rim (our mid-way point)? 

Just looking for general beta here, since I've never been and it's so foreign to me. I'm running my first 100 miler in June, so my rough plan was to run one more bigger race over Labor Day weekend, then relax until around Thanksgiving to do R2R2R. But if it makes way more sense to do R2R2R earlier in the year (say, end of September or early October), I'd do that too. I'm also open to starting at the South Rim instead, but I'm coming down from Montana, so I figured it'd save lots of drive time to just start and finish at the North Rim.

ultrarunning,1641844470,"Can firm shoes still have good cushioning? Please, help me understand. Hi, I am a bit lost and need some help in understanding cushioning.

My shoes (ON cloudultra, 20-28mm stackheight) are almost everywhere described as very cushioned shoes, made for long distances. However, they feel quite firm and stable to me, not plush, and I actually like that feeling very much. (That is the reason why I have chosen these and not others, after trying many others as well.) I have no problem running longer distances (30k for example, still building up) with them, both on trail or road. Now, what I am wondering or confused about is, how can these be cushion shoes while they feel rather firm? Or is there something like ideal cushioning for shorter distances (softer) and ideal cushioning for longer distances (firmer)? Similar like a seat feeling very comfy initially, but not after prolonged use, while a harder seat might feel less comfortable initially but remains more comfortable for longer sittings? Or is all just marketing lingo used to appeal and sell?

How do you think I would feel if would run a long distance in Hokas, or other super cushioned shoes. Would I feel even better or less fatigued? Anybody who made that switch?

So far I always went by feel, ending up with these firmer rides, and I never got injured and enjoyed all my runs and shoes. So there is no real need to change type of shoes. I guess I am just wondering, ... could it be that the grass is even greener on the other side?

This is not as scientific or concise as a u/runner52494__2 but I got some words down whilst sitting in an airport yesterday so here it goes.

The race began in the rainy fog. I started in my lightest shell intending to drop it at mile ten when I saw my crew. I must immediately thank Ann and Bill Brady for being the most wonderful support crew I could ask for. The plan we came up with was to exchange my vests every ten miles, each time holding the same nutrition. I did one bottle of Tailwind, one bottle of water and three gels. I also had four gels in my shorts throughout the race. I took in one gel every 20-30 minutes plus drinking 200 calories or so of sports drink. In the second half of the race I mixed in pretzels, Pringles and pickles. This worked well enough and I only needed an extra bottle of water once which was a relatively quick stop at the aid station.   
I chatted with a few runners leapfrogging with some of them but mostly staying with a group of six people in the first 20 miles. After mile 20 I ran with a woman named Meg (F4) for an hour or so eventually getting separated a bit before the 50k mark.

About a mile before the halfway point is when Leah Yingling (F3), caught and passed me with relative ease telling me how far ahead Maryann (F1) was. To be completely honest I thought I was much further back than that and hadn‚Äôt thought much about placement at that point. Approaching the 50k aid station, I knew I needed to change my shoes. The mud from the framing conditions had caked about 10 extra pounds onto my shoes and I was over carrying that. I switched into another pair of the Saucony MadRiver (my preferred shoe) and thankfully the trails had dried out for the second half. Taking this time was a gamechanger even though Leah put some minutes on me. I still wasn‚Äôt very focused on catching or being caught, but taking care of myself and running my own race. At one point Leah had 15 minutes on me, but I didn‚Äôt know so I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it. A went through a low right after 50k but it was nutrition related, so eating some baby food pouches picked my mood right back up. Seeing this part of the course in daylight was kind of neat! The foliage is so different from Upstate NY as was the trails. Very rocky yet runnable. I loved seeing the cactuses but they didn‚Äôt exactly love me back. I have a fair bit of Texan tattoos on my arms and legs. In fact, the blood on my knees are not from my knees‚Ä¶it‚Äôs from the scratches on my thighs dribbling down my legs all day. I think it‚Äôs beautiful.

Making my way around the second 50k loop wasn‚Äôt as slow going as I had imagined. Because my only other 100k experience was from Virgil Crest, which had much more distinct elevation, I figured I would walk a lot of the hills I ran up in the first half. This was not the case. I actually only walked twice on the same very steep descent about two miles from the finish, which is where Leah caught me in the first loop. I got to the last vest switch aid station with about ten miles to go. Ann (my crew) told me Leah and her pacer had left about a minute earlier asking about how far back I was. At this point I figured that if I was 15 minutes back at one point and was now only a minute back, I should simply continue the pace I was running at and I should catch her. I was also feeling like I had run over 50 miles at that point, so I wanted to be cautious with speeding up. About two miles later I saw them crest a hill expanse ahead of me. I still did not speed up but waited until I was close enough to pass decisively. I came into the last aid station about a minute ahead of her with less than five miles to go. Again I did not speed too much, I focused on what I needed to do, which was not give up and finish strong.

The last section was a rolling downhill so I took advantage of it and opened up. I knew I had that last hill climb to get over before I‚Äôd feel like I could speed up and burn my last match to finish. I increased my pace and told myself that this is what I‚Äôve got and if she passed me then she deserved it. I simply focused on not giving up, on not leaving the pain cave until the race was done. I would not believe or focus on a golden ticket until I crossed under the arches.

Then, it was over. A man held up a large piece of paper that confirmed I had raced my way into the Super Bowl of ultrarunning. I cried a bit, hugged everyone and as I stated at the beginning of this post, am still in a state of wonder.

I once ran a 5k with a friend like 5 years ago but thats about the extent of my experience with organized running events. Back over the summer one of my friends asked me if I would run an ultra with him this coming April 9th/10th ([100k race in GA](https://www.argeorgia.com/endurancehunter100Z)). While Ive never exactly been grotesquely out of shape in my life, I certainly havent been super active over the past few years and covid certainly didnt help this initially. However, back over the summer when he asked me, I started up a hal higdon marathon training schedule just to try to get to a point where I could actually run since I hadnt done basically any serious cardio training since college sports. I was up to about 40 mile weeks but then dropped off a bit over the holidays with traveling. Right now Im back down to about 25-30 miles a week but will ramp this back up over the next 4 weeks to get back to ~40 miles weeks. Im incorporating more strength training now as well as trying to train a bit more for elevation changes (where I live is very flat so this is mostly running nearby bridges or using a stair climber). I will also try to make a couple weekend trips between now and then up to a cabin in the Appalachian mountains that a relative has to train on some of the trails there. Another thought I had was just to try to go for a few runs/hikes where I dont worry about overall mileage but try to stay out there for 8-10 hrs or so to get my body more used to actually moving for long periods of times. My plan has always been just finish and I am currently trying to balance between pushing myself further to get to a better spot physically versus trying not injure myself since that would certainly put an end to it for this year. Ive been experimenting with some gear and food consumption while running on some of my longer runs to try to find out what works for me. My training experience so far has also helped me hone in on what I eat to try to maximize the nutritional value of my food. Overall I havent felt this good physically (and mentally) since college and while ive historically hated running and it was always ingrained as the ""punishment"" activity in sports, Ive finally found my enjoyment in it. However, I do also realize time is not my friend here and the run is quickly approaching. From anyone here experienced, do you have advice on the following: 

1. Given the allotted time, how realistic do you all think it is to finish?
2. Are there areas I should be focusing on or anything I should throw into my training regiment with the limited amount of time left?

So I have a 50K in May which I'm training for, it's in the UK and very flat. Goal is to finish, and use it as a training run for the race I really want to run in July which has a bit more elevation in it.

The first 50K is a mixed road / light trail run with about 200m / 700ft of elevation change. I've already started training for this. The race day is 15th May.

The second 50K is mixed road, and some heavy trail with about 900m / 3000ft of elevation change. This race is on the 2nd July. 

The second race is July is one I want to run hard at, and do my hardest - not a simple finish &amp; learn. I won't win it by a mile, but want to feel I absolutely did the best I could have done.

- Marathon April 2021

Life has gotten in the way a bit so struggled to get back into a routine. June - July 2021 I didn‚Äôt run at all. September - November, highest weekly mileage probably, but quite inconsistent and generally anywhere between 15-25. For 3 weeks in December I haven‚Äôt really ran. My longest run over last 6 months has probably been a mere 7 miles. Although Since about September I‚Äôve incorporated gym strength training 2-3 times a week. 


I‚Äôm not sure where this leaves me? Historically I‚Äôm in good stead but I‚Äôm worried the last 6 months may have caused a major drop off. There is a 50m in 7.5 months time. I think just finishing would be my objective (though my ego is saying push harder). I think I‚Äôd hit a program mid march, prior to that just getting my weekly mileage consistent to 30 miles a week 5 times a week. Do people think this is feasible or am I dreaming? 


PS I have also been on feminising HRT since June 2020 which has huuuugely impacted performance, stamina and injuries but I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs quite a niche thing for people to offer advice",0.066,0.872,0.062,0.2866,1560,280,54,18

I took the following 7 months off of running to make sure I healed correctly (with the exception of very short runs before doing the Pikes Peak Ascent, which was 95% walking anyway). I've been keeping up fitness with cycling and lifting along the way.

Now, completely out of running shape, I'm dead set on finishing that 100k this year, which will be my first ever. My only goal with ultras is to have fun and to finish - I'm always happy to walk as much as I need. So, using a slow progressive overload and 80/20, I'm setting out to finish 3 races this year: the Quad Rock 50 miler (or 25, depending on how I feel) in May, the Yellowstone 50k in June, and the Never Summer 100k in July. 

Starting with just 10 miles a week, I plan to increase weekly mileage by 7.5% each week, with most of the gains on weekend long runs. This means that by week 17, just before the 50 miler, I will be doing about 31 miles. By week 27, I'll be doing 65 miles, giving one week to taper before the 100k. I'm continuing strength training 2-3 times a week and cycling especially for easy active recovery days to get some strain off the knee. 

I'm really excited for these next 7 months. Does anyone think that 7.5% is too much? Maybe even 5%? Maybe get rid of that rigid approach entirely and just go by feel? What other tips to help me succeed on my goals?",0.048,0.83,0.122,0.9707,1536,290,48,17

ultrarunning,1641000591,"Question about incorporating stair workouts First ultramarathon coming up this summer (Buckin Hell 50k). There is a lot of elevation in this race, and my main concern is just finishing before the cut off. I'm averaging around 1000-1500m elevation gain per week during my trail runs, and hoping to raise that by a lot in the coming months. 

However, I'm thinking about improving my hiking abilities by having a dedicated workout each week (maybe multiple times) where I just hike up and down this trail that consists of 500 stairs. My plan is to go up and down these stairs for a bunch of reps, hoping to gain more time ascending and descending.  

I'm just wondering how I should think about how to fit this workout in during my weekly routines. Should it be counted as part of my easy mileage, so to speak, since I won't even be running? Or should I think of it like a gym session? Would you have a separate day for such a workout, or would you slot it in before /after a run on a single day? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also looking for general insight into stair workouts. If you've done this sort of thing, how much do you think it helped with trail ultramarathons with steep elevation? How often would you recommend doing such workouts? (and so on)

Across the Years, held in Arizona, is one of the oldest fixed-time ultras in the world, where you run as far as you can in a day or more. More than 2,300 ultrarunners have logged 450,000 miles at this race that was founded by Harold Sieglaff (1934-2015) in 1983. These were the first four runners who ran this run that first year at Washington High School in Phoenix. Learn who they are and how the race was started.

I have a plan in place to build up to a half marathon in mid-May, and was then going to do Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Marathon to run in mid September.

I already did a 100-mile race last May when it was warm and dry which had a lot of climb in it and I finished running up a hill with a big smile on my face and I only had one tiny blister. So I figured yeah this one is flat it will be a lot more easy. It turned out to become the hardest thing I ever did. I finished yes, but that's kind of a miracle by itself.

Frst of all it wasn't that flat. It actually had climb but the kind of climb where you can keep running which means you wear out your legs a lot faster. Then the weather: It wasn't very cold, around 3 degrees celcius during the night and around 7 during daytime but it was foggy as hell. So with my headlight on during the night it was hard to see anything because I was just illuminating the fog. And it was dark, so dark. I mean it's one of the shortest days of the year so we had like 16 hours of darkness and 8 hours of daylight, very depressing.

Then the terrain, we had a lot of rain this year. One of the most wet years in history so the terrain was really brutal. A lot of parts were ok but some were so muddy and slippery it was more like ice skating instead of running. You can see it in the pictures.

The trail consists of 2 rounds, one clockwise one counterclockwise. So you run a loop of 80K and then you run it again in the opposite direction. My goal was to try and finish it in 20 hours but if that failed I would def,. want to stay under 24 hours. 

I had a dream start and the first 80K was fairly easy. I did it in around 9.5 hours which was great and I was very confident to go out for the second loop. But this is where my preparation failed. I've noticed a lot of people changing shoes en socks from their dropbag. Well I had a dropbag but it only contained food that's it. So I ran with the same shoes en socks the entire race. My feet got wet and I could already feel the blisters on several places on my feet. I kept running until 130K, then it became so bad. I was struggling to maintain my pace. I had to walk a lot. I tried to run flat and downhill but at the checkpoint with 19K remaining the pain was so bad I wasn't even sure if I could make it to the finish line.

Anyway, I decided to go on and walked the rest of the way. It took me almost 4 hours to do the last 19K! I litteraly crawled to the finish line lol but I did finish under 24 hours, in exactly 23:23:31.

Then I said to myself. No way I will ever do this ever ever again. And now 2 days in, I'm like ah well we'll see about next year lol. People call me crazy, even a masogist.

ultrarunning,1640006735,"First 100 miler Hi everyone! I (19F) am looking for advice on training for my first 100 mile race. My history with ultra-running is slightly a-typical so I'd welcome any advice or reality checks. 

Background: Over lockdown, I got very fit, lost weight and was running well but not over any particular distance. For multiple reasons I lost this motivation, gained some weight and stopped running over the winter of 2020. I decided impulsively to run a marathon for my 19th Birthday in March 2021 and trained for about 3 weeks from a base of nothing up to a height of 16 miles. It was very slow (about 5 hours) but I ran the marathon successfully and was completely fine afterwards (no pain, normal walking, could have run the next day). Ideally, this would have sparked me to train based on this success but I didn't, went traveling instead and gained a bit more weight. In a moment of madness I signed up for a 24 looped ultra in the summer of 2021 and had grand hopes of extensive training. However, as you can probably expect, I did not train at all (went on maybe 3 two mile runs over a couple of months) and I arrived at race day in September with literally no base of running fitness. I had planned to drop out but my uncle convinced me to give it a go and I unexpectedly managed to run 55 miles without too much physical struggle. As with the marathon I had little to no pain afterward and no injuries. The extent of it was losing a toenail and a day of mild muscle stiffness. My main problem was taking too long breaks- if took it too cautiously because I didn't expect to do anything, wore the wrong kit and physically could have run a further distance. 

Obviously these are slightly reckless behaviors but I genuinely have suffered no ill effects as a result. There's always the worry of future problems but both my dad and my uncle are long-distance runners so I hope I have a bit of a genetic protection. Anyway, I've signed up for the same race (this time scheduled to take place in June 2022) with the hopes of improving my distance (I would be very happy with 80+ miles but 100 is of course the elusive goal). I hope and believe that 6 months of training could get me there but am unsure how to create a training plan that is both a beginners plan (as I'm not running currently) and reflects the tiny bit of experience I have.

I am also an average sweater, so that means I will get dehydrated over time. Every time I pee, it is very clear, which would indicate I am over-hydrated and I can drink less. 

The problem is: I always have cramps when doing longer efforts. I know the biggest cause for cramps is just lack of training, but even during not-over-my-limit efforts I start cramping up. Another cause for cramps is obviously de-hydration. I usually drink on average 500ml (16oz) to 750ml (24oz) an hour (depending on the weather etc) with Tailwind powder.

Summary from my race report; started leaning severely to the left after about 30 miles during the Daytona 100. Had to drop after 100K due to it. Everything else was going good. Never had this issue before. 

I went to my PT, who is a freaking miracle worker, she asked a load of questions, I showed her the vid of me leaning, she did a number of strength, stability tests.  

So she says; ""I have a pretty good idea of what the issue is, ready to feel it?"" I say sure.

She proceeds to work the area and hits the exact spots that are the issue. So, yeah that's it!

It's the quadratus lumborum muscle, it connects to the ribs, spine and pelvis. She says not only can she feel it very tight, she can see it. She suspects the spasms were so bad and I limped along on it so long it has micro tears, so she will 1st rehab it and then strengthen it. 

It ""leaned"" me due to the connections with the top, ribs, and bottom, pelvis, and the muscle spasming so severely. 

She worked the area for awhile, I did about 5 stretching exercises for the specific area and heat, electrical stim. 

I asked could I have done anything at all to relieve it during the race, she said probably not, once it got that bad it had to be rested.

So there you have it, a mystery solved and hopefully resolved. 

Besides from a little pain from that area when I run, I'm feeling great and back to base getting ready to ramp back up for the Keys 100.",0.111,0.724,0.165,0.9577,1689,323,36,19

Spent the rest of the summer running casually, lifting, and climbing then I signed up for my first 50 in late September.

But I challenged the voice of self doubt and reminded myself that the pain was temporary and kept chugging along. The sun set at mile 45, so I spent the last hour or so in the pitch dark, trying to run downhill over rocky terrain. Still fought through it and drug my half dead corpse over the finish line.

I (31m) am not starting from zero with running, but my running experience is mostly in the shorter distances. The longest I have run yet is a half marathon, and although I run for many years, my training was never structured and pretty on and off. I have followed training plans, and had okayish results in some races with 19:19 in a 5K being my best time, but back then I was in better shape, nowadays I'd probably be around 22/23 minutes. Highest weekly mileage was around 50K.

My question is, is it possible to prepare for an Ultra in six months, and if yes, what should I focus on?

I live in a hilly area, so I get a lot of elevation gain in my runs anyway. However, most of my current runs are between 9 and 15km only, and only consistently get in one or two runs per week. I work and have two small kids, so shoveling time free for training is definitely an issue. It's rather simple to get a good hour in after the kids are asleep, but everything that is over two hours would be more complicated to fit into my schedule and could only be an occasional key workout.

### Training

My goal race is the Keys 100 in May 2022, my plan was to do the Daytona 50 mile as my major training run, take off 2 weeks then kick into training for the Keys. 

I've followed the ultraladies.com 50 mile plan for the 22 weeks prior to the race. Working on my nutrition, hydration, etc. I went into it with a good base of 35 miles per week. 

I completed all the training with the exception of the last long run week due to an ankle issue, which I thought would be my greatest issue, turned out it was not that at all.

My taper was a week longer than I wanted, 3 weeks instead of 2 based on that ankle issue, I don't feel that was an issue in the end.

I changed from the 50 miler to the 100 based on how I felt, the weather at Daytona was perfect and I felt as long as I got 50 miles in the rest was bonus.

My wife and brother-in-law were crewing me. 



### Pre-race

Did a shake out run the day before and had the privilege to run with ‚ÄúUltraPam‚Äù who took the time to give me such fantastic advice and had great stories. Run went well. 

Met a bunch of online friends and just enjoyed the company. 

We had a rental around 2 miles from the 6AM start. Had a nice dinner of pasta and seafood and was in bed around 9:30.

My sleeping had been terrible and if I got 2 hours of sleep before the 4:30am alarm, that would have been a lot. 

I had all my gear ready and laid out; Salomon adv5 pack, drymax socks, Brooks Glycerin shoes, Path projects shorts and liner and Patagonia trail top.




### Race


My plan; 13:30 mpm running, 15:00 mpm walking, 10 minutes run/3 minutes walk.

Every top of the hour and bottom of the hour Huma (100 calories) and water, every :15 and :45 Tailwind Cola (100 calories) for a total of around 300 calories pre hour. 

Real food interspersed. Salted potatoes, PBJ, soup/broth, etc. But keeping to less than 300 calories per hour, I'm pretty comfortable with that. Scaps hourly.


### Miles 1 ‚Äì 30

Just to make it easier I'm going to break the race into 2 parts, the 1st 30 and the last 30+.

Went out nice and easy, feel into a nice groove, chatting with people, just relaxing. I felt good, waiting for that dang ankle to scream at me, never happened.

I was eating and drinking on schedule, plenty of port-o-potties. 

Met me crew no problem, I had another vest that my wife would have filled and ready. I was tryung to keep the 1st 50 miles of crew/aid to a minimum. 

All was well, until......


### Miles 30 ‚Äì 62

I get a bit lost trying to get over the Bridge of Lions in St. Augustine. I didn't have my phone, my wife was charging it and only had my Apple watch to communicate, so I get back on track and my bro-in-law starts pacing with me a bit.


He takes a video of me and says ‚ÄúHey, hey you know your leaning a bit to the left‚Äù. I'm wait what?

I realize I'm starting to lean to the left? Never happened to be before, I mean never.

OK, so I start working standing straighter, no dice. So, for 30 miles its getting worse and worse and worse. I not only can't straighten up, its getting more and more painful with every step. I've had kidney stones a few times and they are my gold standard of pain, this pain was getting as close as anything ever got.

A crew member who ran UTMB ran over at one point and said she had some issue like I was having and it was electrolytes, so I downed some extra S-Caps and had an electrolyte replacement drink, nothing. I was not sweating bad and was keeping up on my electrolyte's. 

I started taking Tylenol, my wife got icy-hot and would roll me when we met, but it was getting worse and worse. I was running with a race friend and he was having his own issues. The last 15 miles I would have to stop every few minutes, get on my knees and press my head to the ground to get a few minutes of relief just to be able to walk. If I simply lifted my wrist to look at my watch it would start the process of pain all over.

Our times were seriously slipping and we started realizing no way we can keep this up for another 15 hours. 

He wanted to get 100K in and we did. Then we called it

### Post-race

So after the quiet ride back to the rental, we got in around 4am, a shower and sleep here is what worked and didn't.

Training seemed to work well, hydration, nutrition no issues. Stomach felt great. I usually don't feel like eating after 40 miles, but just smiled and ate, knowing I had too. 

Gear was good, I would not change anything. I think I had everything covered. I even bought a super small charger to charge my watch in my vest jacket. 

Crew was off the charts great! I mean they made sure I had anything I needed and more. They even picked up Rockeys pizza!!!

Besides the back issue, I felt great, just minor aches and pains. I was not tired, etc. 

The issue, the back!!!  

I still have zero idea what happened or why. I did 2 28 mile runs and 1 30 under even more hilly terrain and it never happened before! I run on the same surface during training. So I'm at a loss.

I have an appointment with a PT who is runner friendly and is good, so hopefully she has an answer for me.

Bottom line; I'm a bit bummed I didn't do the full 100, felt I could have if not for the back and OK with the 100K, I've only ever done the JFK 50, so that was a win.

Thanks for reading nd if you all have any questions or suggestions about what's up with my back, let me know.

Last thing; It was a great race. Dave K. the RD is fantastic, the AS volunteers are super heroes,  the course and weather were excellent. Heck I'm signed up for 2022 already!

## Training
I went into this race with about 3-4 months of devoted training. My biggest training month was October, with 186 miles and 15k feet elevation. November had a bit of a wrench thrown into the training plan due to unexpected family circumstances, which prevented me from training for about 10 days. Not ideal, but I rolled with the punches. I took about a 2 week taper, focusing on keeping myself moving with a lot of walks with the dog, but not as many runs. I did 1 tempo/threshold run a few days out, which was more or less an accident but I needed it for the mental break (the pre-race taper blues is a real thing for me). 

Some more aspects of training that I found were extremely helpful:
* Food training. I found that apple and sweet potato baby food pouches were extremely easy to swallow during my training runs. This along with Science in Sport gels soon were established as my main food. 
* Hill training. I chose to practice running on extremely steep and technical hills. I run with Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z poles, which would prove to be extraordinarily helpful on the course. 
* Time on feet: My 3 biggest activities during training were  (1) 22 trail miles, 7 hour, 6k feet elev (for time on feet), (2) 21 trail miles, 3500 feet climbing, 14min/mi avg pace (stayed in Z2 almost the entire time), and (3) a 20 road mile tempo run (7:59 avg).
 * Recovery weeks: Every 2.5-3.5 weeks I would cut back my mileage and focus on very easy miles for the week, in order to let my body recover. 

## Race Day

An overview of the race course: There were 4 race distances this weekend, a 25k, a 55k, a 50 miler, and a 100 miler. The 25k was the north loop, the 55k was the north and south loop, the 50 miler was the north loop, south loop, then north loop again, and the 100 miler was the 55k course 3 times. Course map is available [here](https://www.southeasterntrailruns.com/uploads/1/0/5/2/105203083/published/2021-bloodrock-11-12-map.jpg?1636810724). 

### Pre-race:
Stayed at a hotel outside of the park the night before. I got no more than about 4 hours of sleep. Woke up around 3am and went over my nutrition and clothing plan for the 74th time while waiting to leave for the race. Got there around 0600 for an 0700 kickoff time.

### Section 1: Mile 0 - Mile 12.8/15.1(ish)? [AKA, first North loop]
Went out a little bit hot. Knocked out some faster miles on the road and service roads on the way to NTH, sticking with Harrison (another runner who I had met at the preview run 2 weeks prior) for a few miles. Ended up dropping her after starting some of the initial climbs. Dropped into the backcountry and experienced the extraordinarily difficult Barkley/Topless climbs. Somewhere in here, I joined a group of 2 guys: one non-descript guy who's name I don't remember, and one guy wearing a Let's Go Brandon t-shirt (those of you who know me well know that I am awful with names and therefore I remember almost nobody's names). From here on out, this group is LGB+Co. because I can't think of anything better. Cruised through Eagles Nest AS at 9.8 miles, grabbing some ginger ale and cheese quesadillas, and topping off my vest bladder with more tailwind. Felt solid coming back in on my first lap with a time of 3:40ish. My watch said 12.8 miles, course map said 15.1, and LGB+Co said 13.4 and 16.2. No one actually knew what mile it was. For the purposes of this race report, that was mile 15.1. We topped up on nutrition, more tailwind, and started the climb out of Cabins for the south loop.

### Section 2: Mile 15.1-35 [AKA, Terrace/Peavine or South loop]
This section was still feeling solid. Definitely more runnable than the North loop for the majority of the course. Some service roads and easy trails were a blessing to be able to stretch the legs out some and jog. After a nice long drop, I ended up at Terrace AS around mile 20.5. Terrace was a beautiful aid station in a big field. Changed out my shirt and socks, re-lubed everything, and popped a few salt tablets to help counteract some of the sweating that the jogging had started. LGB had started dealing with some IT band issues, so we took a few minutes at this AS while he tried to get his IT band worked out. Took a few minutes longer than I was hoping, but we had similar time goals in mind so I tried to stick with them. Right before I headed out, I had a small shot of some Wild Turkey to calm the nerves.

After leaving Terrace, LGB continued to slow, and I ended up dropping them on one of the road sections through the neighborhood. After a particularly brutal technical descent then climb into Peavine, I was dealing with some not-too-hot mental fatigue. Took a few minutes here to get myself collected, and get my nutrition plan back on track. Shoutout to the AS for having pot stickers as one of the food options available, those got me picked up again. Another sock change here because I had plenty of pairs ready, and I had a really comfortable set of socks planned out at the 34 mile mark. Got myself rehydrated, and grabbed my headlight because I'd be rolling into the next AS (Cabins/mi 34) about 20-30 minutes after sunset. Also switched out the lens on my sunglasses for my clear lenses. Headed out from the AS right as LGB+Co got in. That was the last I saw them in the race. If you are a careful reader, you'll see something I did at every other aid station that I forgot to do here ;-)

After about a mile, I went to go drink a bit more tailwind, and realized I had forgotten to top back up on my vest bladder. Some profanities were exclaimed. I estimated how much I had left at around a liter and ensured that I took the next 8 miles relatively gently to prevent myself from losing too much more fluid. I continued to go through gels to keep the electrolytes up. The monotonous trek across the ridgeline for several miles was not particularly helpful for the mental state, so I played some spotify on my phone to keep me going. I took 1-2 breaks when I saw comfy looking rocks and decided to sit and stretch out for a bit. Around a half mile out from the cabins AS, I heard the beautiful sound of cowbell, and picked up the pace again. Got into the cabins around 1700, around 10 hours into the race. My average pace had dropped by that point, down to around 17 minute miles. I learned at this point that a good number of people had dropped at the 55K mark, due to the sheer difficulty of the course. I had told myself coming into this race that I would drop for any physical injury, dehydration, or delirium. I had been dealing with some hot spots on my heels for an hour or so, which prompted a stop by the medic tent to see if he could work any magic. After an alcohol/iodine rinse over the heels, and a sock change, I felt better. He said that the rinse wouldn't fix the hotspots, but would buy me a few more miles before they got unbearable. I estimated that I had between 5 and 7 hours to go at this point. I also heard through the grapevine that there was a 2 hour extension on the original 18 hour cutoff time. My mental state had picked back up, and after filling up with more tailwind, ginger ale, and quesadillas, I was ready to go out for the last section.

### Section 3: Mile 35-50 [A repeat of North Loop]
I had made sure to pay careful attention to the North loop the first time I ran it in the daylight, as well as the information I had gleaned from it during the preview run 2 weeks prior. I knew that the two major climbs were Barkley (short, steep, but not terrible if you put your head down and go), and then Topless hill (a hill that's mentally debilitating... 3 false peaks, and once you get to the top of the ridge, you keep dropping back down and climbing back up for the next while). I caught up to Harrison again on one of the initial climbs, and stuck with that group as I had heard reports of some wolf/coyote packs howling, and I figured that a group would be safer, as well as good for the mental state. Lots of chatting and conversation ensued as we endured the PUDS (pointless ups and downs) that we had to look forward to. I was better at climbing, Harrison was better at descending, which meant that we ended up averaging around the same pace. We came across one of the 100M runners on Barkley, who we stuck with for a bit but soon left in the distance. As I neared the top of the hill, I felt a searing pain on the skin on my left heel. I knew something had happened with the hotspot, and it was too painful to even put that heel on the ground. I decided I couldn't do anything about it anyway so I resolved to not do anything about it until I got to the finish line. Once we got to Topless, I got another wind of energy and proceeded to power up the hill, leaving the group behind me. I took every hill one step at a time. My heel had gone numb, and at this point in the race, I was not feeling any pain anymore. I felt like I was floating across the ground. I rolled through Eagle's Nest again, chugged some ginger ale and ate some cheese, and pushed myself for the final descent and the last few miles. At this point I gave up on trying to eat, as even the though of food was nauseating. The descent out of Eagle's Nest was probably the most brutal descent of my life. My quads were completely shot, and every descending step was more and more difficult. I watched the numbers on my altimeter drop... I started around 1100 and knew the bottom was somewhere around 650-700. The only saving grace was knowing once I hit the bottom of this climb, I was home free. I heard some cowbell (thanks to my amazing crew) at the bottom of the hill, so I knew I was almost there. I finally hit the bottom, took a second to collect myself and check my mileage, and jogged out the last 2 miles. I see the finish line, and jog through it as my watch reads 16 hours and 4 minutes, 11,000 feet of climbing, and 45.8 miles (GPS was rather wonky through some sections).

### Post Race:
The first thing I did was take a shot of Jagermeister to numb the feeling of sheer exhaustion. I stopped by the medic tent again and had him take a look at my heel. Turns out the pain was from the blister forming, and there wasn't much he could do about it, so I went on my way. Crew helped me pack up and we left for the hotel. I laid on the floor with my legs elevated for a bit, ate a bit of food, and passed out.

ultrarunning,1638821720,"Just ran my first ultra! Posting because I want to say a massive THANK YOU to everyone here that gave me advice. I ran my very first 50K and it was AMAZING. I thought I would give back by sharing a bit about my experience for anyone else that might find it helpful or inspirational in some way.

Previously, the farthest I had ever run was 24 miles. (I had done a handful of 30+ mile hikes in the past and some pretty high-mileage backpacking trips.)

I was more of a rock climber than a runner for many years, and would run 1-2 miles on the treadmill a few times a week as part of a regular gym routine. A friend convinced me to sign up for my first 5K in 2019, and I upped the gym mileage to practice running 3 miles which at the time seemed huge! After that, another friend convinced me to sign up for a 25K with her that fall. It sounded absolutely crazy and impossible, but I thought it might be fun to work towards a goal and see what I was capable of. I did it, and at the time it was a MASSIVE achievement for me.

Then of course lockdown happened, and I got into Strava challenges. I decided I would try to get the monthly half marathon badge every month, just as a fun personal goal. I did a handful of other half marathon and 25K events, and after one particularly enjoyable one (and a few beers) I decided to register for a 50K, and that felt ABSOLUTELY INSANE. I truly did not believe I was capable. I figured it would give me something to look forward to and train for. And if I was lucky, I could finish, crawling my way through the finish line.

I did not have a formal training plan. I made up my plan based on what I know about my own body, advice from a few friends that had ran ultras before, and this sub. I had a sporadic baseline of 5-30mpw for all of 2020 and 2021 before I started ramping up training. I did 5 weeks of \~30mpw, then from advice on this sub, upped it to 40-50mpw for 4 weeks (Week 2 I blew it and went past 50, and this was the first time I felt like absolute garbage and like running was miserable. I made it a point not to pass 50 anymore.) Two weeks before the race I dropped to 30-40mpw (honestly, this was tough, I wanted to do more and ended at 39.5), and the last week I did only 10 miles leading up to the race (This was really hard. I was in the habit of running twice a day and found it really tough to stay put.)

As part of the training block, I did a 25K race (I signed up for a 25K that was 3 weeks before the 50K, and a half marathon 8 weeks before, with the idea that this would force me to do these long runs even if I was having a tough time training) and it was AWFUL. It was the same course I had done in 2019, and I think I just got in my head about how much stronger I am now than I was then, and how I needed to beat my old time. I didn't beat my time. I worked my ass off out there and finished two whole minutes slower, and had an absolutely miserable time, cried a few times on course, tripped and fell, and threw up at the end. During that race I REALLY considered dropping out of the 50K. I felt like I had ABSOLUTELY no business running an ultra. If I was this miserable running a 25K, who did I think I was signing up for a 50K? It was a bad time and I was pretty devastated.

I had only one long run planned after that, a 20mi run that covered a lot of the same course as the 50K. It was... OK. It was a lot better than the 25K race, and I made a point to run very relaxed and keep my heart rate relatively low. Run slow. Don't get excited. By mile 16 I was starting to feel bad and was in a lot of pain for the last few miles. After this my thinking was that I MIGHT be ABLE to do the 50K... but it would be absolutely the hardest and most miserable thing I had ever done. And I needed to prepare myself for the reality that it might take me every possible allowed minute, and it might take absolutely everything that I had.

My strategy for the race was to just stay as casual as possible. I wore my favorite old shoes and old clothes. I didn't have an estimate for how long I would take, or a goal time. My only goal was to finish and have enough energy and spirits left to celebrate afterwards. I was expecting to have an absolutely miserable time, and I just wanted to try and enjoy it as much as I could. I even packed tissues in my drop bag so I would be able sit down and have a good cry at mile 22.

I ran with a friend and had casual chit chat with him and other runners for the first 13 miles. At that point we decided to split up and he ran off ahead. I just enjoyed the scenery and tried to look at my watch as little as possible. I took my time at the aid stations and more than anything tried to stay casual. Just another beautiful day out for a nice run. At about mile 20 I could tell my mood was starting to drop, so I put my headphones on for some music motivation. The course started to turn downhill and I started feeling really good. I even started passing some people, which shocked me. Of course that good feeling didn't last, and by mile 24 I started the ""constantly checking how much farther I have to go"" phase of the day. Just 3 miles to the next aid station, then just 4 miles to the end.

The piece of advice that came to me in that moment was one I read here on this sub: When it hurts to run, it also hurts to walk, but if you keep running, you will be done hurting sooner. I just kept running. It hurt but I somehow wasn't upset about it.

Around the time I rolled in to the mile 27 aid station, I started getting emotional. This was the farthest I had ever run in my life. I had just completed my first marathon. There wasn't that much farther. I could do it. It was really going to happen. It was really happening.

During that final stretch, I kept thinking about my younger self. Teenage me, skipping gym class, laughing in the face of anyone who might suggest I participate in any kind of exercise. Even 2.5 years ago me, terrified of that first morning I stayed on the treadmill for 3 whole miles. Anything is possible. I could feel myself on the edge of tears, finally allowing myself to run ""fast"" for that last 5K. Anything is possible.

I am not a fast runner. I am not a natural runner or a natural athlete. I have no idea what I am doing. But I did it. I picked a goal that seemed terrifyingly impossible, and I gave it everything I could. And I absolutely blew away my expectations. And somehow, beyond any dream, I loved it.

1. Have had issues on the left leg before (sprained ankle, calf tightness, patellar tendonitis at different times the past 5 years)
2. I ran a 100 miler 9 weeks ago, and tried to double back for a marathon 3 weeks later. I didn't make the start line, but the past 9 weeks I've been running 0-20mi/week without the pain going away completely
3. Currently the problem is patellar tendonitis, but it has moved to the bursae occasionally
4. In that time I've been seeing my PT to correct an imbalance of the left quad being weaker than the right
5. Still can't seem to shake it off, so today he recommended this treatment

I certainly trust my PT, he focuses on runners, and his in-law who he has crewed for several times is an ultra runner. Also my doc is a runner as well.

## Training

My initial plan for the spring was to run both the Chicago Marathon and JFK 50. My talents and future in the sport absolutely lies in ultras, but I haven‚Äôt quite yet given up on the road marathon. However, after talking with my coach, we both agreed that the 6 week turnaround from Chicago to JFK (while doable) was less than ideal. My rationale was that trying to race both at full effort would lead to a subpar performance for both ‚Äì I would rather really nail 1 race than run 2 I hit at 90%.  Since the 2024 Marathon Trials Standards aren‚Äôt out, I didn‚Äôt want to waste my fall on an all out marathon effort. So, JFK 50 became the ‚ÄúA‚Äù target of the fall with Chicago remaining on the schedule as a hard tune-up workout effort. My entry in to the world of ultra marathoning had been pretty rosy - the #4 American performer ever at 50 miles in the fall of 2020 to breaking a 30 year old, highly respected Strolling Jim 40 course record in the Spring on 2021. Both were solo time-trial experiences, so I wanted a race that offered the competition for me to really measure myself against the best in the sport.

The theme of this training cycle was trying (and failing) to recapture the magic I found last year when training for Tunnel Hill 50. During that cycle, I was crushing 3 long runs a week and seemed to be ascending to ever higher planes of fitness. This cycle included a job change + move - Lexington, KY to Boston for a job with New Balance - and a persistent grumpy left achilles. Both were just enough to keep me firing on what I felt was 90% capacity. Objectively, workouts went well, but I never really got into the groove of training like I did last fall.

I ran Chicago at workout effort as planned and had a blast running [2:24 for 25th place](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVEeIoMsjKZ/) in less-than-ideal conditions. From there, I focused on recovery and nailing the last 6 weeks of training before JFK. The most notable change I made this cycle was to include several trail + road combo long runs to get used to dumping my trail legs off after 90 minutes and shifting to efficient road running. The most notable of these was in Littleton, NH with 10+ miles on singletrack straight into 22 on a flat rail trail. These runs helped, but there‚Äôs only so much you can do to prepare for the mix of hilly trail, flat tow path, and rolling roads that JFK throws at you.

You can see my full training on strava [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17080027).

## JFK Background

It‚Äôs helpful to have a little background on JFK. It‚Äôs the largest and oldest ultramarathon in the country with this being the 59th year of the race. The field is always very competitive and the course has some tremendous history. Names on the all-time list are instantly recognizable for fans of the sport. I wanted to run the race not only to finally dip my toes into the nationally competitive ultra world, but also run a race on a course that would allow me to compare my effort against the titans of the sport.

The course itself is very diverse and after over a half century has taken on a life of its own unique to the event. It‚Äôs not a trail race and it‚Äôs not entirely a road race, so both road and trail specialists can‚Äôt fall back on their strengths. It takes an all-around good runner to compete well at the race. The official course description is below:

*The first 5.5 miles (starting on road surface and joining the Appalachian Trail at 2.5 miles) gains 1,172 feet in elevation. The course from 2.5 to 15.5 miles is on the Appalachian Trail (except for two miles of paved road between 3.5 and 5.5 miles). This section of the AT is very rocky in sections as it rolls across the mountain ridge. At approximately 14.5 miles the course drops over 1,000 feet in a series of steep ‚Äúswitchbacks‚Äù that then crosses under Rt. 340 and connects with the C&amp;O Canal towpath. The ‚ÄúCanal‚Äù section of the JFK 50 Mile is 26.3 miles (from 15.5-41.8 miles) of almost totally flat unpaved dirt/gravel surface that is free of all automotive vehicle traffic. The JFK 50 Mile route leaves the C&amp;O Canal towpath at Dam #4 and proceeds to follow gently rolling paved country roads the last 8.4 miles to the finish. The Boonsboro start is at an elevation of 570 feet. The Williamsport finish is at 452 feet above sea level.*

## Race

The race itself went off 6:30 AM. Hoka runner Adam Peterman and I jumped out front to an immediate lead on the road. I focused on running easy and keeping close tabs on my effort as we climbed the 500+ feet on the road to the AT. Adam and I chatted a bit the first few miles and I could immediately tell he‚Äôs a super nice guy. We had a few mutual connections in the sport and talked a bit about the race itself. We hit mile 1 in 6:19 and Adam remarked ‚Äúonly 49 to go!‚Äù

As we began to climb more and more and approached the start of the trail section, I felt Adam‚Äôs pace begin to inch a little faster than I was comfortable running so early in the race. While I was tempted to ignore reason and try to run with him, I knew the smart thing to do was back off and run my own race. I hit the start of the trail section 11 seconds back of Adam and watched as he scampered off into the woods. I continued to catch glimpses of him at various points until about 5 miles in. I told myself to focus on my race and to not think too far beyond just getting through this first 15+ mile trail section of the race with my legs still feeling fresh and in-tact.

Things remained pretty unremarkable until mile 6 when an unmarked turn through me for a loop. I was 80% sure that the right fork was correct, so I turned and ran about 50 meters down the trail. Suddenly, though, I was paralyzed by indecision and fear of taking a wrong turn. I stopped and ran back to the intersection for another look. Still seeing no indication of which way was correct (other than a gut feeling of how the trail looked), I yelled out hoping some volunteer down one of the trails would respond and provide some evidence my decision was right. When no one called back, I just went with my gut and ran down the original trail I had chosen, losing somewhere between 60-90 seconds.

I had no idea if I was still on course until a mile later when I came across a hiker and asked ‚Äúdid you see another runner up ahead?‚Äù She replied ‚ÄúOh yeah‚Ä¶he‚Äôs a ways up there. Better hurry up!‚Äù Other than being slightly entertained by the unsolicited annotation of the race, I was relieved that Adam and I were at least on the same trail. I still wasn‚Äôt fully convinced I was on course until course volunteers appeared another mile later. I thanked them for being out there and let myself relax that I had indeed stayed on course. ‚ÄúNow just focus on getting to the other side of this trail feeling good and whole.‚Äù

The 10 mile aid station was a burst of energy that was a welcome change from the silence of the woods. I blew through it and headed back up another climb. At the top I had a long line of sight of the aid station area and caught a glimpse of the pack of 3-4 guys chasing me. I took note of the gap and tried to not let it change how I was attacking the trail. So far, I felt good and within myself. I was determined to not let the knowledge that there was a 1-2 minute gap back to the next pack be a catalyst to do something stupid like run too hard up the next climb.

I kept this mindset the next 5 miles as the trail slowly descended and finally hit ‚Äúthe drop‚Äù from the ridge down to the C&amp;O Canal. On the switchbacks I finally had another long enough line of sight to catch a glimpse of the pack chasing me down from the ridge. I took note of the gap but immediately turned back inward and focused on getting off the mountain without falling or destroying my quads.

After a tricky descent, I finally burst out of the trail and onto the road to a line of cheering spectators and crew. It was a nice welcome off the trail and I enjoyed the run down to the C&amp;O canal to meet my crew for the first time. We had rehearsed my shoe/vest swap the night before. The shoe plan was to swap from the New Balance Fresh Foam More Trail to the RC Elite 2, while the vest plan was to swap my vest for an entirely new one with fresh nutrition so that I didn‚Äôt have to mess with refilling bottles. I ran to my crew, ripped my vest off and threw myself into the chair. [My boyfriend helped get my trail shoes off](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWgspR-LWft/) while I was tying the RC Elite on the other foot. I was told Adam had a 7 minute lead. This was the first specific time feedback I had gotten the whole race, and I was honestly a little shocked the gap was already 7 minutes. I was hopeful I could make up some time on the C&amp;O canal. My legs still felt pretty good and I‚Äôve always been solid at running \~6 minute pace deep into an ultra.

The rest of my crew helped get my fresh vest on and gloves back to me as I peeled out of the aid station. I later found out the whole transition was done in 45 seconds - a 10 second improvement from the dress rehearsal the night before! I focused on trying to dump off my trail legs and get in the groove I wanted to hold for the  next marathon of the race. ‚ÄúJust find the flow.‚Äù I started to find a little of it, but the really fluid state I usually find was frustratingly elusive. My achilles started to hurt and got worse and worse for about a mile. It finally started to subside and mostly went away, but I still couldn‚Äôt find the flow I wanted.

I passed an aid station and unexpectedly saw my crew again at 19 miles for some cheers. I waved and blew through, trying to not let on that I wasn‚Äôt exactly thriving. Robbie, a teammate from college there crewing was a few steps past the aid station and told me I was about 7 minutes back. I was a little frustrated that despite having just run 5 or so 6 flat/sub 6 miles, I was still losing ground. I knew then that Adam was probably not coming back, and the best thing to do was to focus on running the canal as well as I could.

I still couldn‚Äôt find any flow, but things at least didn‚Äôt feel hard at mile 20. That began to change at mile 22 when I began to feel the fatigue start to creep in. Suddenly, the enormity of what I had left began to seep into my mind. I started to wonder why, of all the things to do in the big wide world, I had chosen to make ultras my ‚Äúthing.‚Äù I shut that toxic train of thought down and kept telling myself that I had gotten through these races before. It was going to be hard, but I knew this was something I could do. I set my sights on mile 28 when I‚Äôd see my crew again next.

At 28, we had a quick vest swap and another update that Adam was about 10 minutes ahead. I briefly hit a solid groove around 30 miles and for a moment felt like myself. A biker going the opposite direction gave me some love and said ‚Äúyou look stronger than that guy up ahead.‚Äù I latched on to the first and only bit of news I had heard so far that indicated Adam was indeed human and showing cracks. For a few blissful minutes, I actually felt like myself and felt like I may be able to squeeze something more out of the last 20 miles of the race. As soon as it came, though, the feeling left and I was once again confronting the 2ish hours of running I had left.

I made a deal with myself to just focus on getting to an hour left. With under an hour to go, I knew I‚Äôd be able to muscle my way to the finish. If I could just get to that mark, things would be ok‚Ä¶

My last crew stop was at mile 38. I was hurting and they knew it, but the vest swap went smoothly and cheered me on as I headed off on the last leg of the journey. The remaining 4 miles of the C&amp;O canal agonizingly ticked by, and suddenly I finally found myself on the road. The change in surface was an immediate mood booster. The shockingly steep hill at mile 42 was an immediate mood killer. I got halfway up, saw it turned yet another corner, and decided to just walk the hill. I was genuinely afraid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish the race if I ran up the rest of the way.

When the hill finally topped out, I reluctantly began running again and was pleasantly surprised at how my legs were responding to being on pavement. I knew Adam was long gone ahead of me, but I was worried about 3rd place running me down the last 8 miles. Nutrition wasn‚Äôt going down as well, but I knew I needed to keep the flow of calories going. I stopped for 5 seconds at each of the last 3 aid stations of the race and threw back a cup of Coke at each. The new source of calories seemed to hit my system in a way that Gu no longer was able to. Each time I put down a little coke, I had a few minutes of improved running.

Over the last 3 miles, I kept checking behind me for a glimpse of 3rd but never saw anyone. All I wanted to do was walk, but I dutifully trudged forward, each mile slowly ticking by. I finally approached the finish line and laughed at how cruel it was that they gave you such a long finishing stretch for 50 miles. I crossed in 5:35:44 and [have never been more happy to be done with a race](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWhRKNoMD9r/). My crew enveloped me and made sure I knew I had just run the 7th fastest time in JFK history. Adam had run an incredible 5:19 for the second fastest time in the history of the race, just barely missing the course record. I hung around as the next few people came in, and it became apparent that this was one of the deepest and fastest years ever at JFK. On the podium, we learned it was the fastest top 10 in history.

## Final Thoughts

The longer I am in this sport, the more I begin to consider what it is that I want to ultimately get out of it. Pushing your limits as a runner to be the best version of yourself is noble, but at some point I will find where that line is. Eventually, the years of training and racing will be boiled down to a few stats of what I was able to accomplish in the sport. I want an impressive resume and to give everything I can while I am able, but at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why I still do this after 15+ years of competitive running.

What I want more than anything out of this journey is war stories and memories and adventures with people I love. Every time I hear someone like Andy Jones-Wilkins talk about their running career on a podcast, I‚Äôm floored at how easily story after incredible story flows. I‚Äôm impressed with what someone like Andy was able to accomplish in terms of results, but I‚Äôm even more inspired by the way these people were able to use these experiences as a tool for a life well lived. While I have some big goals I want to accomplish in the coming years, I‚Äôm making sure to first and foremost enjoy the journey I‚Äôm on and be thankful that I‚Äôm surrounded by people I love. Because one day, I won‚Äôt really care that I finished 2nd at the JFK 50‚Ä¶but you better bet I‚Äôll still be telling the story of a 45 second shoe change over a glass of bourbon with old friends.

However, I am also trying to generally follow sensible training rules to avoid injury and/or burnout including: 

* 80% of running at easy pace- for me at the moment that's around 6:00/km. However, where I run is quite hilly, so that also slows me down somewhat if I try to keep HR/RPE properly low.
* Recovery running only after a long or hard session- recovery running being even slower than 'easy'
* Walking/slow jog warm-up and cool down when doing harder running
* A long run of a maximum of 3 hours as a general rule
* a rest day at least once a week, and when fatigued

As on most week days I only have a maximum of between 45 minutes-1.5 hours free time for running I am finding it tough to see how I can build to higher volumes while still following the above.

I‚Äôve been running 40-50 MPW since April 2020, all miles on trails. Since April of this year, I‚Äôve been heavily focused on vert, and am at about 275,000 ft of elevation gain in 2021 so far (over 2100 miles ran). My average weekly vert is 6,000-8,000 ft. I honestly prefer running uphills over flats or even downhills so this has been fun for me üòÖ 

However, I‚Äôm slow AF and all this vert training isn‚Äôt making me any faster. I typically do one run a week that I consider flat (~200-300 ft in 5-6 miles) and I have one hill repeat day every week where I get 1,200-1,300 ft in 6 miles. My weekend long runs have only been 10-13 miles lately since building back up from an ankle injury this spring, obviously I‚Äôll have to hit 20 miles or so in training for a 50K, but many of my long runs have 2,000 ft+ of gain. 

My pace on the flats isn‚Äôt much faster than on the hills and I was hoping to see some improvements after focusing so heavily on vert over the past 6+ months.

Eric was the fastest and most dominating 100-mile trail ultrarunner during the 1990s as trail ultras became popular in America. His ‚Äúgo for broke‚Äù race strategy was legendary, as he demonstrated to the rapidly expanding sport that amazing speed on trails could be achieved. During that era, he had the most overall 100-mile wins in the world and would usually win by wide margins. His career-best 100-mile time on trails was 13:16:02. In 1994, he lowered the JFK 50 course record to 5:46:22, which stood for 17 years.  He set more than 20 course records, still holding some of them after three decades and had more than 60 ultra wins. He also won at Badwater and had early ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù at the Barkley Marathons. Please join with me in congratulating and welcoming Eric Clifton into the Hall of Fame.

I have run about 675km in my Ultra 3's this year. They have been my go to shoes for 3 ultras. I spent 10 hours in them for a 100km in the summer and they have been nothing but amazing.

A few weeks ago I ran a 50km and about 13km in i suddenly started to get a hot spot under my foot...this turned into a massive blister that I had to just deal with for the rest of the race. I have never had a blister under my foot before.

My question is has anyone experienced this with a running shoe....feels amazing for along time and then suddenly starts giving you blisters....I have tried a few different socks but still getting the hot spot.

I'm looking for recommendations on decent but cheap (ideally \~¬£20) lightweight running backpack/vest for my bladder.

It doesn't need to fit much beyond the bladder, just keys, snacks, gloves etc. Front or side zip pockets would be nice, as they're useful on my current backpack.

**Context**

I finished my first ultra last month. Edinburgh RatRace, 55k, 3000ft elevation, mixed terrain. Managed 7hrs 22min staying strong throughout, with a sprint finish. So I was pretty chuffed. Thanks again for all the excellent advice here! For training and raceday I used my Omm Classic 25, which pre-covid I used for running to work and still use as my day to day backpack. It worked great (can't recommend it enough!) but was a little big. More importantly it became constantly smelly at those distances, which as my day to day bag that was a pain. So I thought I'd get a separate smaller pack for my long runs.

I normally wouldn't skimp on gear but I spent a lot on improving my gear for the ultra and have had an expensive November on top of that (plus Christmas soon etc) so I'm trying to get the cheapest thing that'll work. It's an experiment and won't see anything longer than a half-marathon for a while so I'd rather go affordable and upgrade later if I need too. But something that could handle future ultra training is preferable.

I loved my first ultra and will definitely do another but for now I'm sticking to half-marathon distance. I'm learning now learning to tap dance and roller skate for a musical I'm performing in next April so I need to be careful with my ankles; plus I've less time atm. Plan is to do a half marathon every weekend slowly building my speed back up, while also doing my daily short runs.

ultrarunning,1636992639,"Looking for advice with some 50-miler issues Hi. I ran another 50-miler at the weekend and am looking for some opinions.

Until this race, I've relied on Tailwind as my fuel (a powder you mix with water), just topping up with what's at checkpoints. Other food I've carried has still been in my bag at the end. But during the second half of the previous two races (both \~50-milers), I've found myself not wanting to drink anything so I wanted to try drinking to thirst during this last race instead. The problem was, drinking to thirst meant only drinking 600ml in the first 3.5 hours (37km), so only 200cal from the Tailwind and 150cal from a banana. It's from this (halfway) point things declined pretty badly with my hamstrings and glutes. I fueled like hell on jelly sweets and got really thirsty all of a sudden, downing 1200ml over the next 2-3 hours. Then my legs felt better and I was able to run properly again for the last 10km of the race.

So, some questions:

1. In total, drinking to thirst meant I only drank 1800ml of water over 7 hours 45 minutes, covering 75km or 47 miles during that time (including one beast of hill). Temperatures were cool. Looking back, while I did feel behind in my water intake at one point I feel I was able to catch it and sort it pretty quickly. I did drink to thirst and didn't finish particularly dehydrated. So I feel my water intake was about right. Am I deluded?

2. The obvious problem is that if I'm drinking to thirst and my fuel is drinks-based, if I'm not drinking then I'm not fueling. I feel the fueling issue in the first half cost me about 40 minutes in the second half, and probably a podium-finish. I like drinks-based fueling, but I really enjoyed not having to force drink down me. I want both! Does anyone else identify with this and have any tips?

I've done a lot of work on my quads so I can handle descents better and not fade on the downhills as races go on. I really felt progress here. The limiting factor this time was hamstrings and glutes. While they were definitely affected by the lack of fueling, and I was able to recover them later through fueling, I feel they need work. The glutes felt stiff in response to ascending (e.g. constant climb of 350m in 3km) while the hamstring stiffness correlated well with me pushing a good pace for sustained periods of good runnable sections (there were plenty). My belief at the moment is there is no point trying to run up the hills yet - I genuinely finish in front of most people who do - so am not after advice on getting uphills quicker, just getting up at the same speed with less being taken out of me. I'm still at a point where I'm going to see bigger returns by running faster on the flats and downhills. 

So more questions, then:

3. While fueling was an issue, I would like to train my hamstrings to be able to sustain pace for a longer period without needing refueling. What's the best training for this? Run as much as possible at target race pace? Or run a mix of medium runs at target race pace and long runs at an easier pace? Something else? I feel marathon training might be what's needed?

4. The nearest hills to me are 3 hours away and I have a 50km route (2000m ascent/descent) that I do there every 3-4 weeks. It helps massively but family commitments mean I can't do any more trips. I have a hill locally of about 30m ascent in 120m that I do downhill reps on, weekly, but I feel it's just too short to be of any use for uphill training. I want to be able to walk hard up a hill like the one in the race and not feel stiff in the glutes - what would you recommend? Can I just sort them in the gym with strength work?

Cheers for any advice. Apologies if it's a bit long - I've tried to be succinct.",0.036,0.842,0.121,0.9965,3740,698,73,47

I just graduated from Ranger School- which for those not in the Army is a 62 day school where you walk around with a heavy ass back pack, barely eat, and don‚Äôt sleep that much. My body is a little beat up and still in recovery mode but I‚Äôd like to get peoples input on good strategies and techniques for getting back into training after ranger school (or from similar circumstances) Some details:

-was running in the 50-65 MPW range generally before tapering for school (I started in September.)

- Did 4x a week of strength training along with running, low rep high weight
- Went from 195-&gt;167 lbs body weight. (5‚Äô11‚Äù male)

- I didn‚Äôt have any extreme injuries in the school but have some pretty bad aches/pain in my shoulder/left knee/lower back.
I‚Äôm going to see a doctor to make sure I am able to train again before actually starting to train.

- I am a somewhat experienced ultrarunner. 3 50ks, a 40 miler, and a 50 miler. (Plus a 100 mile DNF üôÉ)

-I will be eating at a heavy surplus. At least 3.4K cal until I get to around 178/180. Will be doing it clean (or trying my best to. Lol)

- i don‚Äôt have any timeline to be ‚Äúrace ready.‚Äù Just hoping to get some tips from people who have either bounced back to form after ranger school or from similar circumstances 

Thanks!",0.037,0.823,0.139,0.9821,1336,237,35,13

**Race Information**

* Name: Valley of Fire 50
* Date: 13 November 2021
* Distance: 50 miles (my first at this distance)
* Location: Longdale, NV
* Time: 12:52:52 (moving); 13:53:19 (chip; where the hell does this time go!)

**Goals**

* A: Sub 12:30 (no)
* B: Sub 13:00 (moving time, yes)
* C: Sub 14:00 (chip time, yes)
* Overall: Finish without injury (yes!)

**This got stupid long so TL:DR;** I FINISHED! This was the hardest and most fun thing I have ever done. Was it hard, yes. It was hot, the terrain was technical, and, well, it was the longest I have ever run my a lot. The first 34 miles were great. I felt strong, I was on pace to hit my A goal, but the heat was setting and it was between 90-97 degrees for about 6 hours.

And then I hit the wall. Between miles 34-40, I felt like shit. My stomach hurt, I could barely take in food, it was hard to drink, and I was lightheaded. It was so frustrating because my legs felt strong! I wanted to keep my pace and achieve my goal but I just couldnt. I was worried I was going to pass out and fall off the ridge. So I slowed down. I walked. A LOT. Nothing was working so at mile 40, I drank some ginger ale and ate some chips. Game Changer. This is apparently what I need when I am bonking. After this, I was able to run most of the rest and while I did not hit my A goal, I kind of met my B goal and def met my C goal.

The amount of energy I had at the end was insane. Now, the nearly 300mg of caffeine I had taken in over the day probably contributed but the excitement of what I had just accomplished was keeping me going. I got lost a couple times, I fell, I hated life for a while, but I never seriously considered dropping. My training was on point and I had the physical strength. I DID think about sitting at an aid station for a long time, but that was the extent of it. I HAD FUN! I was smiling a lot, enjoying the moment, and while I am sore and my feet are swollen, I actually feel pretty good today.

**Pre-race**

The time leading up to this race was a bit chaotic. My training was going really well. I was finding myself recovering quickly, I was feeling strong, I was ready! I was hitting 50+ miles a week for the month leading up to taper but sadly, my aunt passed away 3 weeks before the race. Flew home to be with family, missed my last training race (nbd, it was a miserable course, lol), and ran flat around IL. On one of my final runs in IL, my pack broke. Like, there was no hope for recovery, especially with the long race coming. So I went ahead and purchased the Salomon Adv Skin 12. Figured why the hell not. That said, I ended up only having 2 runs where I could figure out the proper size of the vest (more below) and really had no idea how to properly pack it for best use. Combined with the taper tantrums, I was a stress ball by Friday night.

Flew into Vegas Thursday night, our hotel was shit and smelled of smoke so Friday, I spent a decent amount of time chatting with Marriott to move to a better hotel. Thankfully they worked with me and I got moved to nicer and cleaner hotels.

Friday was pretty chill other than the hotel fiasco. I spent the day eating, organizing my pack and drop bag, and trying to relax. Breakfast was oatmeal, eggs, potatoes, a Bobo bar (eh, I am not a fan), a banana, and some granola. Lunch was a veggie burger panini (delicious), and dinner was chicken, farro, sweet potatoes, and green beans that we cooked at the hotel. I was in bed by 8pm, thankfully and actually slept really well.

Saturday morning I woke up at 2:15am, got dressed, grabbed all our stuff, and hit the road. Funny story. We left the hotel at 2:45am and ran into 2 people coming home from a night out. Needless to say they were confused and amused to see a runner and mountain biker when they were just going to bed. Breakfast was my standard coffee, oatmeal, protein powder, and banana.

**Course layout**

This was a looped course in the Valley of Fire Backcountry (Nevada State Park). The 50 Miler was 3 loops with a 4 mile out and back. At first I wasnt thrilled but in the end, it was amazing as you were constantly passing and cheering on other runners. There were 4 aid stations (start/finish, 5k turn around, 10k turn around, 13.1 turn around).

**Starting Line**

We were early enough that I had a lot of time to relax and get into the moment. Dropped off my drop bag and the start/finish. Thankfully I was able to use the bathroom.

**Miles 0 to 8**

We were starting in the dark which was a new adventure for me. While I have run in the dark, never on a trail (this I regret just a bit). I was not as confident with my footing as I usually am but it was good as it slowed me down on the initial down hill, and well, I was surrounded by people.

The first 90 minutes or so were in the dark but as the sun started to rise, I was starting to understand WHY people think this race is so incredible. The bright red Aztec sandstone nestled in limestone mountains started to make their presence known. I went through the first two aid stations without stopping, and for the most part, the trail wasnt too bad. There was some climbing but other than the first 0.5 miles which were technical, the trail was flat. Things changed at mile 4 where we started these rolling hills, the steepness of which made the headlands look mild. At mile 4.5 I made a critical error, missed a turn and went down a hill that was likely 40%... WAHO! It was not fun and some poor soul followed me, lol. I realized at the bottom it was not to trail. Moving into mile 5 we entered a stunning valley that took us to the 13.1 turn around aid station, followed by a short 1.5 mile loop with a descent that was mean, essentially a wall of sand with an insane grade. There was definitely some scooching on my hands and butt. I paused at this aid station to grab some more water, a gel, and took back off for the 8 mile run to close the first loop.

**Miles 8 to 15.5**

This segment was mostly back the way we came. It was great. I felt strong! I was keeping an amazing pace and my HR was controlled. The temp was in the 60s and mid 70s so not too bad but I was starting to get concerned as it was not even 9am at this point.

People often ask what one thinks about on long runs. The mind wanders a lot but on this run, there were a lot of distances so I probably spent an hour trying to figure out the bib colors for the various distances.

At the 5k turnaround aid station, rather than go back to the way we came, the ultra distances took a left and did a 3 mile loop. This. Was. Hell. It was steep, not marked well, and really exposed. It was pretty, yes‚Ä¶ but the climbs were brutal. The payoff was great though as when you got to the ridgeline, you could see really well into the valley.

Back at the start, I filled my water, grabbed some watermelon, and took off. The plan was to not hit the drop bag until loop 2 was over. I managed to complete the first loop in under 4 hrs so I was right on target. I was feeling strong and having a blast! At this point, hydration and nutrition was going well. I was keeping up with my electrolytes. I was still eating solid food since I knew when the heat hit I was going to have to switch.

**Miles 15.5 to 31 (Loop 2)**

For the most part, this loop was uneventful. At mile 16.5 I passed my friends who had flown in to do the 5k and cheer me on! They also became my impromptu crew (major learnings here) and apparently were stalking me through the Garmin InReach tracker all day.

At this point it was getting hot. The temp was going well above 90 and it seems that for about 5-6 hrs it was swinging between 90-97 degrees (eeep!). I was not properly heat acclimated so this was becoming an issue. But I still felt GREAT! My legs felt strong even though my plantar fasciitis was acting up a bit. I was plodding along and when I got to the 13.1 turnaround aid station (mile 23 or so) I lathered up with sunscreen, sprayed myself down with this portable shower they had, and continued on my way. I met someone who was also going his 50 miler at this point but sadly he was going to drop after the second loop. The heat was just too much.

At mile 27 I hit the 10k turnaround aid station (first time stopping here) and was starting to really overheat. I told the aid station lady I was just HOT and while one volunteer got me some gatorade, she shoved ice between my back and pack and down the front of my bra. And I will say, it didnt even feel cold. This was a game changer. It cooled me down enough that I got through the next 4 miles without incident and was still keeping my pace. During this time, I realized I had a crew waiting for me, they just didnt know it. My socks were FULL of sand so I needed to do a change but to be efficient with time, I wanted to take advantage of having help so I laid out a plan. I also got lost.

On the final 4 miles before getting back to the start/finish, I took a wrong turn (the markings were missing I think) and I headed uphill when I should have gone down. Sigh. When I realized my mistake, I turned around and caught a rock and fell.I like to think that it was a pretty epic fall as I did manage to flip myself over to land on my side and not my chest. My left knee is bruised and my right leg has a road rash but this is far from the worst fall I have had. I actually forgot about it until we were driving back to the hotel and my knee was itchy.

As I rounded the corner into the start/finish, I saw my crew! They were recording/cheering me on. I asked them to meet me with my drop bag so that I could reload. While I changed my socks and cleaned up my feet (this was absolutely needed), they filled up two bottles with tailwind and water and refilled my hydration pack. They grabbed me watermelon, potatoes, and ice. My friends shoved ice down my bra and back while I ate and they helped slather me in more sunscreen. Seeing people, having people who were just there to support you was an amazing energy boost.

I think my biggest mistake on this loop was falling behind on my electrolytes. It was SO HOT (well into the 90s by now). I was taking in a lot of water and tail wind and took 2 salt pills on this loop but I probably needed 4.

**Miles 31 to 46.5 (Loop 3)**

This is where the wheels started to come off. I took off. The technical part was SO much easier with the sun up :) but my GI system was starting to turn. I was prepared for this so while at the drop bag, I basically just loaded up with tailwind as I had to switch to liquid hydration.

And then I hit the wall. Between miles 34-40, I felt like shit. My stomach hurt, I could barely take in food, it was hard to drink, and I was lightheaded. It was so frustrating because my legs felt strong! I wanted to keep my pace and achieve my goal but I just couldnt. I was worried I was going to pass out and fall off the ridge. So I slowed down. I walked. A LOT. When I got to the 10k turnaround aid station, I went to the bathroom, thankfully I could still pee, grabbed some chips and a jolly rancher, and headed out. At this point I was just trying to figure out what the hell would make me feel better and what I could eat without throwing up. The jolly rancher was not good. Sugar is NOT what I need when I feel that awful.

By the time I got to the 13.1 turnaround aid station, I was in a bad way. I grabbed some ginger ale and more chips. The aid station guy sprayed me down with the shower and I went out. Amazingly, I started to feel better, I COULD RUN AGAIN! So when I got back to that aid station, I filled up one of my soft flasks with ginger ale and grabbed more chips. This was the trick. The ginger ale calmed my stomach and the salt and fat from the chips were gentle on my stomach.

I was running again, slowly but I was running. My only goal at this point was to get this super sketchy descent before sunset. I JUST made it, but doing that in the dark would have been terrifying. At the 10k turnaround I grabbed more water and chips, and at the 5k turn around I grabbed more chips and a salt pill. At this point, there was no way I was going to hit my A goal but it was technically possible to hit my other goals.

Unfortunately, I missed that fucking turn again on the final 4 miles! It was dark and I missed the turn, went up hill, and when realized my mistake, called to the woman ahead of me so she didnt go any further the wrong way. After this, I was feeling pretty good. With the sun down, it was cool and I really wanted to finish. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to stop at the start/finish but I had enough water, one more gel, and only 4 miles so I blew through the start/finish and just kept moving (apparently I glared at my crew, sorry guys!).

ALSO! My watch died. At the beginning of the day, I had changed the battery settings because my HR wasnt being tracked and forgot to change it back. So at Mile 45.5, it went dead. I was able to turn on Strava on my phone but this was no bueno. I need to dial in my settings better because the Garmin Fenix 6 can absolutely last longer than it did. I should also carry the charger, just in case.

**Miles 46.5 to 50.2**

I took off down the technical section again in the dark, and ran as much as I could. At this point, I was sore but I had that final burst of adrenaline and probably ran 75% of these last 4 miles. I even passed someone and there was no way I was going to let him catch up! Turning around, heading back to the finish, I was just so happy. It was a bit hard to navigate in the dark but there were people around to help. On the climb out, two jeeps came right up to the entrance and since my headlamp is reactive it turned off which freaked me out. Their lights were blinding and disorienting so once I climbed out of the valley, I didnt even realize I was done! I ran across the finish line, and met my crew!

**THE END**

I got my medal and one of the race organizers came over to get me some food (seriously, these people are amazing). I wasnt hungry but ate a burger, more chips, and a chocolate covered date (omg, perfection).

The amount of energy I had at the end was insane. Now, the nearly 300mg of caffeine I had taken in over the day probably contributed but the excitement of what I had just accomplished was keeping me going. I got lost a couple times, I fell, I hated life for a while, but I never seriously considered dropping. My training was on point and I had the physical strength. I DID think about sitting at an aid station for a long time, but that was the extent of it. I HAD FUN! The new pack worked out really well, even though there is some redness on my back. I was smiling a lot, enjoying the moment, and while I am sore and my feet are swollen, I actually feel pretty good today.

**Learnings and General Comments**

* Aid station volunteers are incredible people. I knew this, but they are crucial to success with ultras.
* Ice against the skin is critical to lower body temp.
* Ginger Ale and potato chips are a must when I bonk. Amazing.
* Until mile 34 things were going well and nutrition and hydration were great, but I should have taken in more salt. I do not fare well in the extreme heat so I need to rethink running races in the desert, lol.
* The new pack was mostly ok. It felt great on, it was easy to use, didnt bounce, but I wish I had more practice with it as it was sometimes hard to find what I needed. I didnt put any anti-chafe cream around the area where my bra and pack meet at the mid back. There is some redness but no chafing, thankfully.
* I likely took in 3000 calories and 10L of water over the course of the day. Mostly this was in the form of Gels, Chews, and Tailwind but chips and bananas and watermelon were also consumed. My nutrition was dialed as best as it could be given the heat.
* Caffeine after mile 25 is a must.
* At some point a blister did form on my right big toe on the side. I didnt realize it until I took my socks off. I had a feeling it might happen due to the sand. I had put some tape on my toe before the blister but it fell off. I need a better solution. Changing my socks after loop 2 was a good idea.
* There are sensitive areas that chafe in the heat‚Ä¶ lesson learned.
* Smiling helps. Seriously. It kept my mood up.
* I am just so happy I did this. I am glad I listened to my body and that I was able to troubleshoot the stomach issues.
* While I am not thrilled with my time, I feel that my effort was steady and the best it could have been due to the heat.",0.085,0.77,0.145,0.9997,16531,3196,538,232

### Background
This race was supposed to be run back in April but Covid meant that it was rescheduled a few times.  The course runs along the length of the river Test in Hampshire (UK), starting in the hills just North of Andover, and rolling down to the Solent in Southampton.  The path itself is just over 44 miles, so there's a loop of the hills at its source added to bring it up over 50 miles.  There's two concurrent races - 44 miles and 50 miles (for those who want to do the extra loop).

Living not too far from the Southampton end of the river, I've run many sections of this course, so thought it would be fun to try and do it end-to-end in one go.

### Training
I ran the London Marathon in early October. The rescheduling meant that this race fell a little too soon after for my liking.  I tried to defer but left it too late, so thought I'd see if I could coast in from my London training which had been in the 50-70 mpw range. 

I had 7 weeks to prepare.  I needed 1 week to properly recover from London and at least 2 weeks to taper, so that left 4 weeks to try and get some decent weekly mileage and some long runs in.  

I managed two 50+ weeks, and two 70+ weeks, with back-to-back-to-back long trail runs in the last two weeks. maxing out at 27 miles for my final long run.  This all went OK.  I finished the training block with no injuries and about as confident as I could be, although I felt that another week's training and an extra week's taper would have been welcome.

### Pre-race
I know from experience that an empty stomach on the trails really kills me, so I've learned to graze almost constantly as I run.  This meant I spent the night before packaging up so much food to carry with me: bags of banana chips, dried mango, buttery mashed potato, seaweed, and a massive bunch of gels.

I had an endless debate about which shoes to wear.  The trails are really well kept gravel, there's a bunch of road sections and the weather had been pretty dry, so I was tempted to try it in my Ghosts, reasoning that cushioning would be welcome in the later miles. However, some of the trail runs I'd done in the taper were a bit slippery underfoot due to autumn leaves falling, and just general November drizzle, so I opted for the grip of my Catamounts.  This was the right choice.

On the day of the race, I woke early to make sure I could get a decent breakfast in, and then drove to the start line.  The town I live near is at the Southern end of the Test Way, so my drive up largely ran parallel to the course I'd be running. This gave me sense of just how far I'd signed-up to run.  It was daunting.

I arrived, dropped my bag for the finish line, meandered around a bit and then made my way to the start line. I was feeling simultaneously under-trained and under-tapered, but I was committed now.

At 8:00 the 50-mile race started and off we went.

### Race

### Miles 1-10
We set off on the loop through the hills at the Northern end of the Test Valley.  There were some pretty steep climbs.  I settled in to a 9:00-9:30 pace.  It was pretty crowded to start with, but the first few hills stretched the pack out.  As always seems to happen, I found myself alone with no-one close behind, and a  knot of runners in the distance.

The scenery here was stunning. Once we were at the highpoint, you could see the Test River flood-plain stretching out for miles below you.  There were a handful of red kites circling above and below in the valley, and I even saw a pitched aerial battle between some kites and some crows.

I could see the runners in the distance, and was really tempted to try and catch-them.  Similarly as the occasional runner passed me, I wanted to try and keep ahead.  It took a lot of effort to keep my pace level.  I kept repeating the mantra ""their pace is none of your business"".  This helped, although I did find myself hoping that some of the people in front might blow-up so I could catch them, then realised that this was really uncharitable.

The loop finished with an insane descent back to the start line. It was really loose underfoot and just a dead straight and steep drop.  A quarter of the way down I realised I couldn't fight gravity, there was no way to stop without falling, so I gave into the momentum and concentrated on finding solid footing with each step.

I sailed through the first checkpoint and on the Test Way proper.

### Miles 11-20
These miles looped us through small villages and hamlets.  Lots of thatched cottages and farm buildings. It was largely road, largely downhill, so I kept pushing and was holding a comfortable 8:30 pace for most of this.  I had an internal debate about whether or not this was too fast, but reasoned that I felt good, I'd managed some big weeks and big runs, maybe this was my comfy pace.

The knot of runners ahead of me had started to break up, some disappearing ahead, others slowing down.  I picked off a couple just before we came into the first major climb of the path but decided not to push up the hill to gain distance. Instead I took this at a walk, broke open the bag of mashed potato and munched my way up the hill.

As things flattened out again I picked up the pace once more and passed through the second aid station without stopping.  I pushed on for a few more hills before hitting the Northernmost point of the trail that I'd reached in training runs.  It was all familiar territory from here on in.

### Miles 21-30
By about mile 21 I was reaching the tail end of the 40 mile runners. We'd give each other a nod and pass pleasantries.  Once runner told me that I was currently in 8th place.  All of the uncharitable thoughts hoping for runners in front of me to blow up came back, and my pace picked up a bit.

The route took us through some farmland, and the open vista allowed me to catch sight of runners 6 and 7 about 1/3 mile ahead of me.  Runner 6 was looking strong and pulling away but runner 7 seemed eminently catchable.  I kept pushing and slowly reeled them in.

The route twisted and turned through some more hamlets and as I came around a corner, runner 6 was a couple of hundred meters in front on a walk break.  As I caught up she picked up the pace and we ran alongside each other for a 1/4 mile.  She was inspirational - 59 years old, and pushing harder than most people half her age. We hit another hill and she stopped to walk.  I was in 6 place, with 1-5 nowhere to be seen.

I was starting to feel tired now but not terrible.  I'd slow to walk up hills but was still able to push on the flats.  I reeled in a few more of the 40-milers and stopped at the next aid-station for a quick refuel.  I couldn't get my Tailwind packet to open, so after a bit of fumbling, I opted just to top-up with water.

### Miles 31-40
These next 10 miles were just attrition.  The path is a repurposed railway line, so flat and straight.  The path is bordered all the way by trees and shrubs.  It was just a relentless plod along a tree-lined tunnel.

At this point things were getting tough.  My quads were starting to sieze and I was forced to start taking walking breaks every few miles to stop the pain from becoming too intense. I'd also found that although I could chew food, I couldn't swallow.  I swapped from potato and banana chips to munching on seaweed.  The bitterness and the salt made a welcome change from the sugars.

I started passing quite a few of the 40-milers along here (identified by having yellow race bibs), at about mile 34 I passed another 50-miler (white race bib).  We spent a bit of time walking and chatting, before I picked up the pace and moved on.  I was now in fifth place.

Towards the end of this interminable section I passed another white bib, and then a bit further along another two who had stopped to walk.  By my calculations I was in second place. This spurred me on to the penultimate aid station.

### Miles 41-End
At this aid station I filled up one bottle with cola, another with water and grabbed a handful of cherry tomatoes.  These were the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and their memory lingered with me for the next few miles.

The path here took us away from the flood-plain and back into the hills.  I'd run this section countless times over the years, and the local knowledge really helped me work out when to push and when to slow down.

There was a fair bit of undulation, and countless stiles to clamber over.  The already screaming quads were not having a good time here at all. The stiles, the hills and the distance meant I was starting to feel in a bad way.

Just as we reached the top of the hill I passed another couple of runners.  I noticed one had a white bib.  If my count was correct, then I was in the lead! This spurred me on, and I pushed hard down through the woods back to the floodplain.  My plan was to try and get far enough ahead that I didn't look catchable, but not so hard that I'd blow-up.

As we came through the meadows on the outskirts of Romsey, I was overtaken by a white-bibbed runner.  They were looking strong and I realised that I had no chance to catch them.  Shortly behind them was another few 50 mile runners.  They were all gaining and I had nothing to give.  I was in too much pain in the quads to keep pushing.  I slowed to a walk to try and get some freshness back in the legs.  Once I hit tarmac I could push on again, but as soon as I hit trail the uneven surface set my quads off as they tried to balance me.

I grudgingly accepted that I'd blown-up with just 7 miles to go. I decided not to try and keep up with the runners catching me, and it was a relief when I slipped down to 4th place.  The goal now was just to finish.  I walked the next mile, stuffing my face with the last of the mashed-potato and guzzling down the last of the cola.  My hope was that this would give me a second wind and I could finish strong.

I ran-walked through the fields just checking off the miles.  With just 5 miles to go, I started to feel terrible.  Cold-sweats, nausea, heart palpitations, eyesight going funny.  I was worried that I'd not only screwed up the race, but my body as well.  I stumbled through trying to work out what I could do - I didn't want to DNF this close to the end. Then the penny dropped. I realised that in the last few hours I'd downed half a litre of cola and eaten 4 double-espresso strength gels.  These were all the symptoms of too much caffeine (something I am very familiar with). This took the edge off the panic, and I was able to pick up to something approaching a run again.

These last few miles were pretty bleak in terms of scenery. The fields and woods had given way to industrial units and arterial roads: at one point running a narrow path between a breaker's yard and the motorway.  I walked the trail ran  and the tarmac for these last few miles and was overtaken by the 5th and 6th place runners.  I didn't care, I just wanted it to end.


Finally, with dusk descending, the trail spat me out into some suburban streets and I looped around these until I reached the finish line.  It was over!


### Post-race
I picked up a bowl of mac-and-cheese and forced down the first few mouthfuls. Then my brain realised I was hungry and I devoured the remainder.  I tried to change out of my trail shoes into some comfier footwear, but my quads had other ideas.  It took about 5 mins of dealing with cramps and spasms through my quads before I could get into some dry socks and shoes.  As the food and change of clothes took effect I started to feel human again, and wandered outside to clap runners through the finish line whilst I waited for the shuttle bus back to the car park at the start line.

### Thoughts
That was brutal. 

On my long walk through the final miles I had plenty of time to reflect on what went wrong. I think I committed most of the cardinal sins.  I didn't respect the training, I didn't respect the taper, I didn't respect the distance, I didn't respect the other runners' ability, and I changed my goal mid-race.  Why I thought a middle-aged man who had barely trained could win it, I don't know. Being up in the top 10 should have been a warning that I'd pushed too hard, rather than an incentive to push harder.  Those last 7 miles were nemesis to my earlier hubris.  

Although I was pleased with my overall finish time, if I had stuck to the original plan of 9-10 min miles and not focused on my position I'd have had a much better experience.  This is a common problem for me and I really need to reflect on whether or not I'm ever truly going to enjoy ultra races, or if my mindset is geared more towards the challenges and contours of road-races.

That said, the event itself was amazingly well organised. The aid-stations were run smoothly, the course was exceptionally well marked and the whole thing was just a slick operation.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to do a 40 or 40 miler in Southern England.

ultrarunning,1636835453,"Am I just plain doing it wrong? Ok, I'm back with more anxiety about my upcoming Very First Ultra (50K) the first week of December...

2 years ago today I ran my very first 25K trail race. Today, I ran the same exact race again, which I signed up for as sort of a training race for the 50K. Since 2 years ago, I have been training (what feels like) a LOT. In prep for the 50K, I had a couple months of 30 miles/week, and then (from the advice of others) ramped up to a few weeks of 40-50 miles, before a 2 week taper before the race. (25K was today's long run, have a 20mi planned for next Saturday.)

Honestly, I was expecting to easily blow my time from 2 years ago out of the water. And I didn't. At all. It was HARD. I don't have official results yet but it was very close and I'm pretty sure I was a few minutes slower. And- I was miserable for the whole second half. I think a big part of this was that I was fixated on beating my old time (so I was running faster out of the gate than I intend to run for the 50K.) But I was honestly miserable the whole second half.

Differences from 2 years ago? My body feels absolutely fine- no foot pain, leg pain, sore hips, knees, at ALL, while 2 years ago my legs, hips, even arms, were terribly sore afterwards. But while I was running today my heart was POUNDING and I honestly kind of felt like my heart was going to explode.

This was the first race ever (and I've done a number of ~25K races sine then) that I felt this way and first time that I vomited at the end. I was HOPING to feel like ""ok, this is halfway, that sucks but I can do it"" but instead I felt like death afterwards. And I spent a lot of time thinking that there is honestly no way I should be doing a 50K and I should just drop down to a shorter distance.

For reference: 28yr old female, RHR 60+/-5 depending on menstrual cycle, average heart rate today was 162 with max 185. In 2019 for the same race it was average 166 with max 196.

Am I going to survive this 50K? Would you drop down distance? I would be so disappointed but I'm afraid I'm going to have an absolutely terrible time. Or that my heart is going to explode. I thought I was more ready than this. (I have a doctor's appointment this week and I will probably unload all this on her but I'm sure she won't have anything helpful to say, because American healthcare)

It was going so well and it being such a perfect race for me, I was leaning towards going for the full 100, that's how well training was going.

Well I'm reduced to a fast walk, but finished. 

Went home and did rice. But it was pretty sore, decided to rest the ankle and pass on the 15 miler the next day. 

Seemed to be dong OK, 4 miles Tuesday was fine, 12 miler yesterday around 9.5 miles it started ramping up and while I slowed, it hurt.

Not asking for medical advice, I'm pretty sure its a tendon and I'm going to try my best to get into a Dr. today. Although if anyone had a similar issue advice is always nice :)

I've been in my new home for 6 days and I already feel lost without a treadmill. I need one. It's necessary for human survival. 

I run a lot and love treadmill training and want the convenience of it at home. My last treadmill was a standard in home treadmill, not a commercial series, and I used the heck out of it in the two years I owned it. I think I would be lucky to have the deck last another year. 

My spouse and I are both runners. I would say our treadmill will probably be used a minimum of 750 miles a year between the two of us. 

Money is not an issue, I want a quality product that will last and measure up to our needs. I would like a treadmill with a decline setting. I live in a flat area so getting to hilly trails is a challenge and not something I have time for in a normal week outside of specific race training. It would be nice to have more accessibility to terrain in a treadmill. 

Does anyone have any recommendations?

i got into running during covid esp early pandemic times (logged longest trail run may 2020 at marathon ish distance) but have not been consistent with weekly training and maybe have only have had 15-20ish mile weeks this summer and last few weeks. he makes it sound as though if i have not been doing consistent marathon training for the last 6 mo i should not be considering these plans and starts his weeks out with 30 mi a week.

### Training
Coming off a [disappointing DNF at Western States early this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ociagi/race_report_dnf_at_western_states_that_was_rough/), I was eager to get more hill work in.  I signed up for this race shortly after Western States.  With ~8,000' feet of elevation, this would be a good change of pace from my relatively flat training programs.  
Still putting in ~70 MPW, with some more hill work.  Still running every day, race day was 3,237.

### Pre-race
I was a bit nervous for the hills on this race.  The [elevation chart on the website definitely looked intimidating](http://www.tusseymountainback.com/course-info/ccw-course/ccw-elevation-profile).  It was hard to predict my finish time.  But figuring I'd walk a lot of the hills, I originally estimated between 10-12 hours.  The course was mostly crushed gravel, with a few short paved segments, so I wasn't at all worried about technical trail running.

Got up to State College (WE ARE!) on Saturday afternoon.  Ended up staying up pretty late watching PSU lose to OSU.  

Set out my fuel / drop bags.  I planned on 1 gu every 4 miles, and 1 chew pack &amp; salt pill every 8 miles.  Similar to my Western States strategy.  Aid stations every ~4-5 miles, so ample opportunity to refuel along the way.

Planned on one change of clothes &amp; shoes around mile 27 if needed.

Got to the start line around 6AM.  It was ~45 degrees with a light rain.  I wasn't sure if I would need a jacket, but ended up putting it on about a minute before the start at 7AM.  The rain was forecasted to stop by around 9AM.

About 70 ultra runners, and a bunch of relay teams.

### Race
**Start to Mile 17**

The ultra runners started at 7AM (with relay teams starting incrementally over the next few hours).  The first leg was pretty dark, so I stuck with a pack of runners with at least one headlamp.  The sun came up about an hour in and it was fine at that point.  Gentle incline over the first 3 miles.  Passed the first aid station at mile 3 (no refuel needed) and really got moving on the downhill.  The runners really started to separate at this point.  Downhill to aid station at mile 7 (another no refill) went pretty quick, then flat to aid station at mile 11.  There was one moment around mile 11 that I felt light headed, which was scary.  Reminded myself to keep fueling at every opportunity.  

The next incline felt pretty long, and this is where I ended up taking off my jacket and stuffing it in my Salomon bag.

I really liked having the elevation chart available on my phone (though at times it was difficult to use with sweaty / cold hands).  Gave me a great reference to know what to expect on the coming leg.

**Mile 17 to 27**

Another nice downhill from 17 to 20.  Passing mile 20 just after 3 hours, I realized that 10 hours was definitely within reach, and possibly even 9 hours, as long as I didn't slow down too much on the upcoming hills.  This was encouraging, and I set an 'upper target' of ~12 minutes per mile on the upcoming hills.

Miles 20-25 were the single biggest hill on the course, which involved a lot of walking, but I was still able to stay between 10 and 13 minutes per mile.  The hill wasn't particularly steep, but it felt SO LONG.  Used a lot of 'run .25, walk .25' strategy.

At each aid station so far, I would just zip in, grab some chips / pretzels, refill a water bottle if needed, and zip out. 
 I realized I kept forgetting to empty my pockets at aid stations.  At this point I probably had 6+ gu and chew wrappers in my pockets.  Whoops!

25-27 was a nice downhill.  This is where I first started to notice a few relay runners zip by me.  Changed clothes at the aid station at 27. Picked up a nice encouraging note from my wife from my drop bag.  Stopped for about 12 minutes, which is a bit longer than I had hoped for.  But the change of clothes and shoes was very refreshing!  It was difficult to get all my gear back in the drop bag, but the aid station volunteers were amazing help!


**Mile 27 to 41**

Kind of blurry at this point, but just kept slogging along.  Miles 34-41 had a long uphill followed by a long downhill.  I was leap frogging with a handful of other ultra runners at this point, which was somewhat motivating.  Muttering motivational comments to each other with each pass.  I was definitely on pace for 9 hours at this point, and I kept that target in mind.

I was stopping more frequently at aid stations, trying to stay full on food and water.

**Mile 41 to Finish**

Mile 41-45 was another huge hill.  Stayed between 9-11 min/mile, which I was quite thrilled with.  Again, the hill wasn't too steep, it was just LONG!  Always a few runnable segments along the way.  

Got to the aid station at 45.x at around 8 hours, and realized I could definitely do &lt;9 hours.  Mostly all down hill, so I ate some sour patch kids and just cruised along.


### Post-race / Reflections
Scarfed down some pizza, changed, and started the 3 hour drive home.

Did way better on the hills than I thought, which led to a much better than expected time!  Definitely a nice confidence booster.  

Overall really liked the course.  Enjoyed the great views of forests in central PA.

Now I need to keep up the hill work, get some more trail work in, and eventually get back to Western States!  Philly Marathon in a week, and the next big ultra is Umstead in April 2022.

Just keep moving...

ultrarunning,1636485186,"Deadman Peaks Backbone 100 race report. Won the race two days after finishing thru-hiking the Continental Divide Trail. I don't make smart decisions. Deadman Peaks Backbone 100. 106 miler in Cuba, NM Nov 6. 

I've always been curious to see how a ultra would go after a thru-hike and the Deadman Peaks race lined up really well with the end of my SOBO CDT thru-hike. 

The plan was to finish 7-10 days prior to the race. Rest, eat, run. Well. I ended up hiking with an awesome trail family. Took a buncha zeroes in NM. Had a fantastic time in Silver City, 4 days of non-stop drinking which culminated in a crazy halloween party where our gang of 15+ hikers got cut off at the bar before 11pm lmao. 

Ended up finishing the CDT on Thursday Nov 4. We pushed about 160 miles from Silver City to the border in 4 days and 6 hours. Crushed a watermelon with my thighs at the border because that was a running joke since my trail name is Quadzilla. Dinner that night was a giant plate of loaded carne asada fries from a greasy Mexican joint in Lordsburg, NM. 

Not at all ideal to have moved 160 miles in the week leading up to a race. Even worse my sleep and nutrition were fucked. Basically just backpacking food- subsisted on a 3lb bag of sour patch kids the last night/day on trail because I ran out of all my other food. Friday meals: eggs and veggies for breakfast(pretty amazing), can of chili and pinto beans for lunch because I was stuck at the house with no vehicle and didn't feel like walking, a Blake's lottaburger fries and a milkshake before I boarded a single prop 8 passenger plane to ABQ. Then a burrito as my friend drove me to Cuba NM from ABQ. 

Wednesday night we hiked until 1am to push miles due to a long stretch without good water. Woke up at 7am the next morning with the sunrise. Thursday I slept okay but fitfully from all the excitement. Friday night I made the mistake of setting up my tent next to the start/finish and couldn't fall asleep due to the generator and general nerves and also the cold. Wore every layer I had huddled in my sleeping bag trying to stay warm. Did that fitful sleep where you're never really quite asleep. Woke up at 4am with diarrhea caused by the burrito because my body had lost its tolerance for spicy food. Then laid in my tent until around 5 and started getting ready for the race so I was decently sleep deprived going in. 

I really had no idea how this would go. The only real run I'd done in the last year was a random marathon I ran on Sunday, Oct 31 because I figured I should get a run in with all the zeroes we were taking. Well that took 5 hours and felt terrible and I was sore until Wednesday so I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to finish the race. Aside from that I was busy with work all winter and just lifted, and had spent the last 3.5 months just hiking. 

Thankfully the temps weren't god awful at 6am. It was around 30, felt like 24 is what someone said. We started out with I believe 23 runners for the 106 miler. The course was 26.5 miles out and back on the CDT making two 53 miles laps. It was neat to run on the same trail I'd just hiked a few weeks prior. 

I started conservatively. I remember hearing on a podcast that if you feel good at the beginning of a 100 miler you're running too fast and if you feel like you're going too slow you're still running too fast. So that was my approach just keep it nice and slow. If I finished this would've been my first 100m completion. I figured averaging 13-14min/miles would be ideal. I'd run rim to rim to rim and this same race 53 miler in 2019 and madness in Moab 24hr race in 2020 where I completed 95 miles. 

The course is a gentle climb on dirt roads and trail the first 5 miles. Then a steep technical descent off the Mesa, ~4-500ft cliff essentially. Then you're at the first aid station. The middle nine miles are the most challenging. Mostly trail over rocky terrain that beats up the feet, following rock cairns, and a constant rolling elevation gain and loss. 

The last 8ish miles to the final aid station was the easiest part of the course. Mostly dirt roads and not much elevation gain/loss. I made it to the turnaround point at almost exactly 6hrs. Stuffed my face and continued on. I was around middle of the pack here. A lot of people had blown past me at aid stations not really taking time to eat. I just did my best to focus on me, get in as much food as I could, and not worry about what everyone else was doing. 

As the day continued temps rose and the sun was relentless. This was a huge advantage for me. We'd been hiking in this same sun/heat for weeks now and I was completely acclimated. It didn't bother me in the slightest and in the next 18 miles I passed everyone until I was in 3rd place. I was so stoked. I would've been happy to finish top 10, now it looked like top 5 was possible! 

At the mile 9 aid station I saw 1-3! So I scarfed down some oranges, a banana, some eggs, ate salt pills, and forged ahead. I was feeling REALLY good at this point. I think I accidentally took a caffeine pill. I'd been saving those for the night and wanted to avoid it while it was still hot, but I just had a fire in me so decided to take advantage of the energy. 

Passed #3 within minutes of leaving the aid station. Then we entered the big climb back up the cliff face. Climbing was another area the thru hikes gave me a huge advantage. I could just power up them as I was used to climbing 6-10k a day, everyday, with 30-40lbs of gear on for the last 3 months. That's where I lost #3 and played a little mind game as we talked haha, telling her how easy the climb felt without my pack and just generally tried to display an outward appearance of being 100% fresh. About 1/4 up the climb she said ""I don't know why I'm trying to keep up with you"" and fell back. Success!! I was really pushing it, but I didn't let it show. 

I caught up to 1st and 2nd shortly after the top of the climb. They were walking and looked tired. I debated staying with them but I knew it was 5 miles all downhill and I felt GOOD. So I took a risk and decided to blow by them, build a huge lead so that they wouldn't even try to catch up. I must've passed them going at a 7 min/mile pace. Entire focus was to appear fresh, motivated, and not tired at all. My splits down to the start line were all 10:00-10:30. 

Finished the 53 miles around 11hrs 45min elapsed. Ate some tacos and ramen at the start finish turnaround and blasted back on my 2nd loop. Again pushed as hard as I could when I encountered 2-4th place when they were 1-2 miles out from the turnaround. By this time I figured I had a good 45 mins on them and hopefully had just crushed any hope in their mind that they could catch up. 

I pushed, probably too hard to the first aid station. I think that split was a 1:45. Pretty good for being 62 miles into the race now. By this time the sun had set and the cold was setting in. The first aid station sat in this valley and damn it was cold. I ate potato casserole, stuffed my vest with a few waffle gu things and continued on. Definitely started feeling my fatigue in the middle stretch. Took me over 3 hours to make it to the next aid station, so slowed down almost 50%. 

Ate pie there and continued. By this time I'm starting to feel all the classic ultra pains. Eating ibuprofen like candy, popping caffeine and salt pills, I had to go dig a hole and stomach was starting to feel weird. But soldiered on. Made it to the last turnaround at 130am I believe. Thankfully the guys there had a roaring fire going so that was super nice to sit around. Ate broth, oatmeal with bananas. 

I was extremely paranoid at this point that someone would catch me. It'd taken another almost 3hrs to reach this aid station and the guys there said 4 people had come into the mile 18 aid station just 15mins after I'd left it. This gave me a burst of motivation and I put in four 12 min miles on the dirt roads headed back on the final marathon of the race. 

At this point I'm in a lot of pain but so determined to win. My mind is filled with paranoid thoughts as I hadn't seen anyone yet after turning around. ""What if they saw me coming, turned off their headlamps, and hid in the woods so I wouldn't know how close they were??"" 

I'm also starting to hallucinate mildly. Sticks look like snakes. Trees look like people. Rocks look like cows. 

I finally see the headlamps from four runners that are all within half a mile of each other. By my estimate I was now about 7-8 miles ahead plus one aid station. And they were all walking on a stretch of flat dirt road!! My psychological warfare worked!! Everyone was super nice and congratulated me on the strong race. I jogged by attempting to move as fast as I could and show no signs of fatigue. I just want to say all the mind games were in a friendly spirit of competition and not malicious ü§£ 

Somewhere around here I had to poop for the third time and it looked very dark, so I think the ibuprofen was making my intestines bleed. Oh boy! By this point though I didn't give a fuck. I was going to win if it killed me. 

I pushed into the mile 18 aid station feeling pretty done. Ate a little ramen but eating was definitely getting tough. Put down some pie that went down more easily. Debated drinking coffee but opted not to add more variables to my already rocky stomach. 

Those next 9 miles were rough and it was over 3 hours again to the next aid station. At this point I started having trouble breathing. This happened on my 24hr race too. I don't know if it's the desert dust or just that much exertion but I start to get fluid in my lungs and deep breaths become impossible and will cause a fit of hacking coughs. 

So I make it to the last aid station just as the sun is rising. It's getting harder to breathe. I can barely eat anything. Force down a few bites of oatmeal, drink some water, stuff 4 gu packets in my vest and continue on. I have no idea where anyone else is at this point and I absolutely didn't want complacency to cost me the win. 

I thought how devastating it would be to be this close to winning a 100 only to lose it because I couldn't put forth the little extra effort. To lose because I gave into discomfort was absolutely unacceptable. So, I fucking gave it my all. I'd walk 4-5 seconds then jog until I couldn't catch my breath. Rinse and repeat. 

The final climb up the cliff was bad but also not that bad. I was dreading it because of my difficulty taking full breaths. But I just slowed down, took a few 5-10s breaks, ate a gel and made it up with no real issues. By this time the sun had fully risen and I received a nice boost of alertness. 

I started jogging downhill from the top and I swear someone had changed the course. I didn't remember the trail having this many turns! It certainly didn't have all the small uphill portions on my last lap. It was profound mental torture as I grinded down the Mesa feeling like I wasn't making any progress. 

Finally I made it to the dirt road which was the last 2.5ish miles of the race. I figured if I could get a mile on that road and still not see anyone behind me then I'd have the win secured. 

I tell you what that road was the longest damn road in the universe. Someone had certainly added extra turns to it since the last lap. 

After an eternity of agony I FINALLY saw the finish line stretching in the distance. There was still no one in sight behind me. And it became real. I was going to win this race. I was actually going to WIN a hundred miler!!! Not only that I was going to win a hundred miler two days after finishing a crosscross-country thru hike!! I was going to win my FIRST hundred miler!! 

Beyond excited I sprinted the last quarter mile to the finish line for all I was worth. I finished the race in first place after 27 hours and 50 minutes. All my paranoia was unfounded. 2nd place came in at 29 hours and some change (waiting on the official times to be put up). But I'm still glad I was able to keep my focus and really give it my all instead of giving into pain and fatigue and relaxing my pace at the end. 

100 milers do such weird things to the body. My core temp dropped down to 96 for a bit two hours post race. I shit more bloody stool. Thankfully no bloody urine. I coughed up gross phlegm that still held the shape of the little channels in my lungs. Again thankfully not bloody. 

I slept for 6 hours, ate a bunch of food, then slept another solid 10. Actually felt surprisingly okay on Monday. Definitely sore but not nearly as bad as my last 24hr race. And today(Tuesday) my legs actually aren't sore at all. I did some bodyweight squats just to test the system and it...feels fine. Was even able to bust out pistol squats no problem. So strange. 

Ankle and knee joints are a bit creaky and stiff but other then that you wouldn't even know I'd run an ultra Saturday. 

The thru hike obviously had tremendous training benefit for the ultra. A few takeaways: 

* zero feet issues. No blisters. No real pain even until the last 15 miles. I never switched socks or even took time to shake out my socks. Only took the shoes off once to remove a rock, wore REI gaiters with lone peak altra 5s and it really kept debris out of my shoes. I switched to this corkwood Sole insole this hike and I think it really helps pad me feet from all the rocks and whatnot that cause feet pain. I got a bunch of blisters when I started the hike this year because I started out with big 25+ mile days. After the first month no problems whatsoever. 

* joints felt great. What little random knee/joint pains I had was easily managed with ibuprofen. I've hiked roughly 7,000 miles now and all that time spent under a weighted pack has really made the joints bulletproof I think. 

* I was able to eat a tremendous amount of real solid food. It wasn't until the last aid station that I couldn't force much down. Thru hiking you're putting down 4-6,000 calories a day, everyday, and eating all day so that was super helpful. The 24hr race I ate candy and drank soda 

* recovery was just off the charts. Walking for a few minutes or sitting for 5 seemed to recharge my legs to a remarkable degree. I suspect when you're hiking 12-14 hours a day for months your system becomes extremely efficient at eliminating cellular waste products and shuttling nutrients back to the muscles. And yeah it's Tuesday and I'm mostly pain free, just a little stiff if I sit for a while. 

* the mental toughness built during a thru-hike is probably the biggest benefit. I never considered quitting. With each new pain I knew it'd be temporary and I'd be fine after the race finished. You experience so much and different types of pains and discomfort during a thru that my overall pain tolerance was definitely higher, and it helped a lot to not worry if this or that pain at mile 50 would be debilitating by mile 100. 

* hiking across the country also really helped condition for mental fatigue. When you're used to hiking until 8-9pm everynight on a regular basis and sometimes push to 1-2am, adding on an extra 8-10 hours doesn't seem like that big of deal. I only started feeling antsy those last 9 miles. Before that the mind was in the familiar thru hiking groove. Just one foot in front of the other and eventually you'll make it. 

* I think having walked through the blazing desert the last few weeks and being acclimatized to the heat is what secured the win for me. That time from 12-5pm really took a toll on people and without that edge I doubt if I would have been able to catch everyone or create the big lead. 

* I've been practicing vipassana meditation for 5 years now and that was another critical factor. As pains arose I could simply see them as pain and accept the pain fully. I didn't create extra suffering by wishing reality to be different then what it was. The practice was extremely helpful when the night dragged on and I found my mind wandering and losing focus. That practice of continually bringing awareness back helped me to reign in my mind, stay focused, keep my pace and keep pushing and not get lost in random thoughts and lollygag around walking slowly. 

* the meditation practice definitely helped me not to panick when my breathing troubles started. Again I knew it was temporary, and reality was reality so instead of getting down and thinking that this would ruin my chances of winning I just managed it the best I could and continued onward. There were a couple coughing bouts that made me feel like I was going to pass out! If the race had continued past 106 miles I would have dropped though. It would have become a safety issue if I'd been out much longer and it continued to get worse. 

Thanks for reading this ridiculously long race report. I am beyond stoked to have won a 100 miler. I honestly never thought I'd ever win a 100. I've never been a great runner as I'm usually sitting around 200lbs and have been a weight lifter for most of my life but I like how ultras don't require you to be fast. 

I'm going to work my ass off this winter, enter more races, and see how I fare competitively with proper nutrition and actual rested muscles! The race was amazing. Great people, well organized, beautiful course, perfect weather. Definitely the most intense and difficult thing I've ever done in a day. 

I was definitely in that zone of ""oh my god I'm never ever going to enter another 100 miler"" toward the end but thanks to our wonder amnesia toward pain I'm already stoked on the next race.",0.116,0.748,0.136,0.9983,17517,3321,411,230
ultrarunning,1636479068,"Training and intermittent fasting Hey all, curious to get some thoughts as well as your approaches about this. I‚Äôve learned a lot about the health benefits of intermittent fasting (and have utilized it a lot), and also the benefit of doing low intensity exercise while in a fasted state. The main idea being that you better train your body to efficiently use fat reserves by doing low intensity exercise during a fasted state (12+ hours since last eating). I‚Äôve also heard proponents of this in the ultra endurance community, with the same idea being that low intensity Z2 training when your body is utilizing fat reserves for fuel is a good thing because you don‚Äôt dip into glycogen reserves and you can train your body essentially go and go (albeit at low intensity) without the need to replenish glycogen. 

Personally I‚Äôve found that I can easily do low intensity Z2 running for 90-120 mins or more while in a fasted state without needing any fuel (or hydration either for that matter) assuming I‚Äôve been well hydrated before heading out.

Today I read an article by David Roche for trail runner mag [here](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/the-connections-between-overtraining-and-underfueling) about connections between overtraining and under fueling, and related injuries. I‚Äôve never suffered any overtraining injuries but this got me thinking more broadly about these schools of thought and the crossover of intermittent fasting and exercise/training.

For long runs or more high intensity runs I usually head out with an empty stomach and start drinking/ fueling about an hour or 90 minutes in and keep it up as necessary, and have had fine results with that but just figured I‚Äôd throw this general topic out there to the community to see your approach!",0.034,0.895,0.07,0.8103,1788,283,19,10

Background - consistently do 80-100km a week, 3:09 road marathon. I've done several backyard ultras (50-70km) in trails in the Netherlands, and in July and September ran the Eiger Ultra Trail and the Mozart100 (108km, 5000m D+) without either turning into a death march at the end.

I'm running Val D'Aran (105km, 6100d+) in early July next year. Due to some Covid-related postponements, I also have guaranteed entry to the London marathon and New York City marathon in October and November 2022. These are bucket list races that I've been waiting years for, so there's no way I'm not doing them.

My question is, I've 'accidentally' got enough points to try and get a lottery spot in the UTMB CCC in August. This would be 8 weeks after Val D'Aran and 4 weeks before London. I think I could handle VDA and CCC with the 8 weeks in between, but I'm worried about feeling fried going into London after a heavy summer. I wouldn't be racing London hard, and would like to enjoy the day.

The toss up is this:

1. Try for CCC. This would be a good way to test out a decent chunk of the UTMB route, the full race of which I'd like to run in the next 3-4 years. It would also be good mountain experience/training, as living in the Netherlands I have to take what I can get OR;
2. Sit out the CCC, use the points to try and get into the full UTMB in 2023 (after also running VDA I will have plenty to attempt the lottery under the new Running Stones system).

I'm in a pretty hilly, urban area. I have some decent hills available near me, for example: one that's 0.6miles with 106ft elevation gain, another that's 0.22miles with 72ft gain (so a bit shorter/steeper)

I'm ready physically to do some really tough hill workouts, but all I can seem to come up with is just doing a billion repeats on the neighborhood hills, which is nothing like the workout in my training plan.

ultrarunning,1636204179,"General base building for my first trail 50 miler? Hey all, wanted to bounce off a tentative base building plan as I look toward running my first 50 mile trail race (4.2k of vert) in June on my 40th birthday- I‚Äôve been a runner for 10 years but have mostly run flatter municipal trails and roads, and less single track/ hills/ vert/ technical stuff, and my longest race distance so far is is a 3:20 marathon. Long term/ pipe dream goals could be a sub 24hr finish at Leadville 100, but wanna take it one step at a time for now.

Transitioning to more technical/ verty stuff has been a bit of a rough process, I‚Äôve already taken a few bad falls, one of which I smashed my knee on and was out for almost a month, so a lot of the focus for me right now is just getting comfortable on more technical terrain and avoiding bad falls. I‚Äôm also a drummer for a living, and if anything happens to any one of my limbs it impacts my ability to work. 

With my family and work schedule I can drive to some good trailheads on M,W, and F mornings. Weekends are more family focused with some work mixed in as well, so not planning on doing a ton of long runs then. So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with for now (obviously we‚Äôre heading into winter so I‚Äôll need to be flexible with it)

Monday- 2+ hr trail run with significant vert and a mix of technical trials and easier stuff, mostly joggable

Workout Wednesday- 2ish hr run on a flatter/ quicker trail with moderate vert to mix in tempo runs, hill repeats, etc

Friday- 3+ hr long run which includes a summit and lots of vert- power hiking/ climbing/ scrambling on more technical stuff and running when the terrain allows

And then just doing some easy recovery runs/ cross training on the days in between, maybe with some longer runs sprinkled in occasionally to get those back to back long efforts, and taking rest days as necessary.

How does that look? Anything I‚Äôm overlooking? Right now I‚Äôm comfortably doing 50 or so miles a week, with a bit of an end of the year push here to hit my Strava annual goal of 2,100 miles (I took it easier over the summer and then my knee injury sidelined me for a few weeks so playing catch up).

(28/F) I'm planning to run my first 50k in March and I'm starting to put together a training plan. My plan is to complete Sally MCrae's 30 Day Strength + Running program in her new app and then begin my ""official"" 50k training in December (this will give me about 14 weeks to train for the race). I've been maintaining about 15-20 mpw and doing yoga with strength about 3x weekly.

As for my running history - I've been a runner for my whole life. I ran cross country through high school and then got into longer distances in college running many half marathons and two full marathons in my early twenties. In the last 5 years I have maintained about 15-20 casual miles per week, and run a few trail races ranging from 13-20 miles. I'm also an avid hiker/ fast-packer and have done multiple 30+ mile single day pushes in the last year (Loowit trail/ Wonderland trail section with 11k elevation gain), and consider myself a strong uphill hiker.

My main priority for race training is to prepare myself for the distance without injuring myself in the process (I'm woefully injury prone, but working on it). Usually for me this means 3 runs and 1 hike per week. I have some local trails I can run on during the week, but anticipate most of my hill and trail work getting done over the weekend. I'd really like to incorporate strength work and yoga into my training as well. 

Is this reasonable? Does anyone have a 14ish week plan they have used with success in the past? Any resources to share? Any advice for a noob??",0.017,0.875,0.108,0.9791,1559,283,35,17

ultrarunning,1635968893,"A more relaxed approach to training? Hi, long time lurker, twice road marathoner and first time ultrarunner here! English is not my first language, apologies for any mistakes. 

TL;DR: Very mediocre runner takes her running wayyyyy too seriously to the point of obsession. All game and no fun. Looking for advice. 

For both my road marathons I (34F) used the Pfitzinger 18 week, 55 mile training plans. I really enjoyed the overall mileage and mid-week long runs and found the plans quite doable. 

I followed the plans very strictly. The first time I think I really followed 98% of the plan to a T with all mileage at the prescribed paces. It worked well and I did pretty good on my first marathon, but really prioritized training over everything else (work, relationship, social life) and frankly, I think it crossed the line from what is supposed to be a relaxing hobby to more obsessive territory. Especially considering I am an extremely middle-of-the-pack runner (PB on the second marathon was 3:53), I really don't need to obsess over my training plan to the point that it takes the fun out of it and hurts other aspects of my life. 

My training block for the second marathon was less strict and I missed a few runs and workouts due to vacation logistics, depression and COVID-shots side effects. I still better than I expected during the race, but I have beaten myself up about the 'failed' training plan. 

I'll be running a 44 mile ultra in the spring and will start my training block soon. This is my first ultra. I would really like to approach this block with a more relaxed approach to training. Still putting in the mileage, but be less anal about it.

I've been recovering from Patello Femoral Syndrome in my right knee since 2015 which has hampered my longer distance efforts altogether. With that in mind I don't have any time objectives in mind, just a finish would be magnificent as I have no idea how my knee will feel past marathon distance. I have a home treadmill &amp; gym and I'm very close to the race course so access to elevation/terrain isn't an issue to do a really condensed training cycle. Here are some observations/concerns ranked from most important to least important:

**Training** \- Not going to really follow any training plan, just focusing on time on feet for the next 3 1/2 weeks and doing 1 hour of strength training a night, probably a combination of  30 minutes conditioning ([https://fitness.mtntactical.com/exercises/](https://fitness.mtntactical.com/exercises/)) and 30 minutes of rowing. I work half of the day from home so can walk on the treadmill at an incline for 3 hrs a night and run for an hour in addition to doing the hour of strength. Suggestions on how to transition casual running fitness to a chill ultra distance? Will the above regiment 5 days a week and one long (2-4 hour Run on course) 3x before race day on course outdoors be sufficient mileage/distance for race day?

**Blisters** \- For some ungodly reason my heel &amp; toe skin is very blister prone in recent years. I run trail in  a trusty pair of La Sportiva Ultra Raptors but it doesn't matter which kind of synthetic sock I use, my heel or baby toe develops a blister. Tips on how to mitigate this on an ultra run? How many times would you change socks during this distance?

**Temperature** \- Course runs 100% along the River Valley and forecast puts seasonal temperatures between -8¬∞C (high) to -15¬∞C (low) but my thoughts are that it will be colder as I will be running adjacent to a frozen river. I have appropriate clothing and will layer with base layers &amp; Gor-Tex etc. For Winter Ultra runners, can you offer any tips with acclimatizing to temperatures/staying warm while on course?

**Terrain -** Packing some Yaktrax Pro and 1 Black Diamond Carbon Z pole for stability on the ice. Any tips in this area?

**Hydration -** The course appears to be self-supported in a 25 KM circle. I have a Nathan Vapor Airess Vest with a 2L bladder but I drink a lot of water while I run so I'm a little worried about running out of water on course. Basing this assessment on my first 25 KM baby ultra where my bladder was bone dry at the 12 KM aid station. Would it be a worth investment to get soft hand bottles for the front pockets? 

**Nutrition -** Digestion isn't an issue so I can eat throughout the run. I like Lara Bars, 'Made Good' Rice Krispies or Go Macro Bars and will bring Gels, NUUN &amp; Salt Tabs in my pack. I'm also thinking of a drop bag at the 25 KM aid station for some loaded Sweet Potatoes, Fruit, Tapioca Pudding and a Waffle PB&amp;J. Suggest your favourite Vegan nutrition?

**Watch** \- Will be wearing my Garmin VivoActive 3. Will it last all day??? haha

ultrarunning,1635695986,"Pacing thoughts + kinda 6hr report Hi gang,

I had a pretty fun longest run of my life yesterday here on the Oregon Coast in the [Dia De Los Muertos endurance run](http://www.ardoradventures.com/ddlmer/). They held 6-, 12-, and 24-hour events of a 2.4 (ish) mile mixed surface loop; I took on the shortest one, and in the week leading up I was hoping to hit 18 laps or 43 miles.

That would mean about an 8:22 average. I'd never gone over the 50K distance before, but figured I'd at least take a shot at my goal distance. I'd gone sub-4 for 50K (\~7:40 pace) earlier this year on a much harder course, so... it wasn't TOTALLY preposterous as an idea.

I also knew my actual ""moving"" pace would of course have to be faster than 8:22 to account for aid station visits and bathroom times. I still managed to overdo it just slightly to start the day (hitting 8:00 rather than 8:10s) but felt generally comfortable. Slowed a bit to the mid-8's as I got up closer to 20 miles, but still was generally within reach of my 43 mile goal... until my ""reasonable"" pace slowed to high 8's, low 9's, mid 9's. Ah, crap. I re-evaluated and figured out what I needed to do to safely hit 17 laps (\~40 miles) and cruised in for the last hour.

All the gory details here on Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/6189453230](https://www.strava.com/activities/6189453230)

So when all was said and done, I got my ""B"" goal and won the 6 hour and had a great day, but am still left wondering what I could've done differently to get closer to squeezing in that coveted extra lap. It's entirely possible the answer is just ""nothing"" given how I'd trained the last few months (consistent 50-55 mpw but short on long runs &gt; 15 miles, aside from one 50K at the start of October).

But for the sake of discussion... if your goal pace for a race is 8:22 (or 9:22, or 10:22, or whatever else), what does the ideal mile one actually look like? Your halfway mile? Your 80% finished mile?

My thought is to maybe do 40-45 this week and then 20 next week before the race.

I signed up for a 250K race through the Belgian Ardennes. I would suspect I wouldn't be able to cover this distance without some sleep for at least a couple of hours. Especially since the course is unmarked and everything has to be done with map and GPS on very technical terrain. So I can't afford a lot of sleep debrivation.

Now the race is in february so the conditions can be anything from snow to rain, freezing colds etc.

So I probably need a bivy to sleep in. I wonder what you guys recommend. Plus should I carry one with me or put it in the dropbag? I guess putting it in the dropbag will save me some weight but on the other hand, I won't be able to sleep earlier if needed to.

## Steps how to start running:

* The very first thing you want to do when learning how to run is figure out how far and how fast you should be going. You can measure this by using a heart rate monitor or an app on your phone that tracks the distance traveled, time taken, speed of movement, Etc.
* The next thing you want to do is stretch thoroughly. Don't forget the stretches for your calves and glutes! This will reduce how many injuries occur when running. Make sure you don‚Äôt overdo it though, otherwise you might pull a muscle or hurt yourself further instead of helping.
* If possible, try to go running at the same time every day. This will help your body get into a regular rhythm and make it easier for you how to start running.
* Be careful not to overdo how to start running if you‚Äôre just starting out, otherwise injuries might occur.
* If there is any pain involved when how to start running, stop immediately and seek a doctor.
* Get a friend or family member to help you how to start running if necessary.

* Do not push yourself too hard how to start running in the beginning, either. Instead of feeling good about how much exercise you‚Äôre doing, it will just feel like a chore if how to start running is way too difficult.
* Don‚Äôt how to start running too often at the beginning. If you do then your muscles won‚Äôt have time to recover and they might get injured (see image).

### Training
I didn't train for this race. I had my main goal race, a 50 miler, on 9/25. I figured I'd coast between races, which is pretty much what I did. I took 9 days off after that race, did mostly easy runs, one speedwork session, and one 20 mile long run in the interim. The long run was for a different race's training and was way faster than what I'd do training for this..and it was last Sunday, so, uh, not my smartest move. I didn't have a true goal for this race, it was my first time running the format. 

### Pre-race
I jumped in puddles on purpose on Thursday's trail run. I then realized last night that my shoes were not dry, and un-backlaced them to let them dry. I wore a skirt and a thermal top, but packed other options for the bag area. I felt weird having not prepped anything for this race, I was very unprepared.  I showed up 30 minutes before the start. It was around 39 degrees, sunny, gorgeous running weather. We had a pre race meeting (then went right into the start) slightly before I was ready with no warning, so I shoved my shoes on quickly and didn't back laced them. I had many friends to run with, and I was mostly there to have fun with them.

The race is a 6 hour event where you run a 1.7 mile loop as many times as you can in that period. The loop has some scrambling, some gravel, hills, and some nasty rocks with gaps in one section. 

Pretty quickly it became evident that my stomach was not happy. I was painfully bloated and had some GI issues. I also overheated immediately, so shed a layer and grabbed a tank after the first lap. Delay one! 

Then I needed the bathroom on lap two.  My stomach continued to be painful for at least two more laps. On lap three, I finally decided to relace my shoe properly. Much better, but I still wasn't happy. I started really feeling down. I knew I wasn't trying to race, but all my friends were ahead or far behind me. I hated that I wasted time on shoes, bathroom, and changing. 

Well, after a few laps of thinking about quitting, I realized my stomach felt better. I had continued taking my nutrition, perhaps a gamble, but it worked. I felt better the longer I ran, though the splits don't really tell that story. By the time I ran 22 miles, I did math and realized I was close to hitting 50k but probably wouldn't be able to swing it. 

I did my last official loop, but told the RD I was still going to 50k, but I knew it was done. My friend joined me for the painful last mile-ish. I hadn't mentally prepped myself for doing an ultra, and I also hadn't prepared!

### Post-race
We all left earlier than usual post race. There weren't finishers to wait for since we all finished at the same time! The swag for finishing is a glass, completing my set for the set of races put on by the RD. It was awesome seeing all my friends hit their goals, but I was eager to get home and relax.

I've heard lots of ultra runners say their training strategy isn't focussed on how long their long run is but more just the total weekly mileage.

ultrarunning,1634942125,"[Race Report Video] The 2021 Cloudsplitter 100 in Norton, VA, US Hey everyone,

I've gotten a lot of help from this reddit in the past by reading race reports and watching other's race videos. In return, I wanted to share my experience this past weekend at the Cloudsplitter 100. This was my A race for 2021 and I trained all year to make it successful. 

I filmed myself throughout the race and cut it all together during recovery (I couldn't walk for a couple days after the race so I had plenty of time!). YouTube has finished processing the video and I've got it scheduled to premiere at **7PM EST tonight, link**:

 [**The Cloudsplitter 100 Mile Ultramarathon - Norton, Virginia - 2021 - YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHeEvft-iww) 

This is a long video at an hour and 20 minutes. It may be too long for some, but I believe it does the race justice and will serve as a useful resource for future runners. I love Kerry Ward's channel, he does long race videos like this, so I tried to mimic his style with just a bit more editing. 

 A little about Cloudsplitter. It is held in Norton, Virginia, US. The town of Norton is a special place. The Norton community activates around this race and it's an incredible orchestra to behold. A HUGE thank you to all the volunteers who helped with this race and an even bigger thanks to my dad and wife for crewing me on this journey.   

I would not consider Cloudsplitter a particularly scenic race. Despite its name, there aren't great mountain vistas waiting to greet you around every bend but there is plenty of climbing and it stunningly beautiful to run the trails at their peak fall foliage. What makes Cloudsplitter a unique challenge is that it is a difficult and rugged mountain race featuring miles and miles of rock gardens, over 50 creek crossing, blistering cold mountaintop winds, and at least 19,000+ ft of vertical gain (5800+ meters) that is heavily back-loaded in the last 25 miles. It gets max UTMB points and has a 40-hour cutoff. It's not the most popular race but I would argue that this year's race had a very strong field of runners toe the starting the line.  

The running, filming, editing, all of the work that I put into this video is the cumulative result of a TON of training and practice. I'm NOT a videographer, professional runner, aspiring YouTuber, none of that. I welcome your constructive criticism as I do intend to continue making race videos in the future as I take on new challenges. I want my videos to standout and be both informative and entertaining. Running long distances is my passion, and this video my passion project. I hope you enjoy. Leave me a comment below with any questions about the race or about how I filmed it. Please share this video if you know someone interested in this race. I'd love to hear your suggestions for my next hundo.",0.044,0.783,0.174,0.9973,2851,505,95,30

However, I haven't really practiced nutrition. I have a wide variety of gels I can use, and have my favorite flavors of Gatorade and whatnot, but I haven't practice running with ""real food"". 

BTW the format of the race is an ""all you can run"" 8-hour event on a 6-mile loop. I plan to consume one gel + water during each loop. Then between loops I was planning on drinking Gatorade + eating 100-200 calories of something else.

The problem is I'm not sure what that 'something else' should be at this point. I was thinking stuff like Pringles, pretzels, bread, banana, etc.

I have a final 18-mile training run this Sunday, so I'll try to simulate the race environment by taking a gel+water during each 6-mile segment (about halfway through), and then consuming 100-200 calories of real food to test some foods out.

### Training
I signed up for this race 7 weeks ago, with very little summer base training under my belt due to graduating from college, moving to Boston, and starting a new job. Training consisted of running when I felt like it, one workout a week (typically VO2 max intervals or Uphill Athlete's 30/30s), and weekend trail runs with moderate levels of vert (3000-4000 feet in 12 miles). My ""peak"" training effort was hiking the Presidential Traverse in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, which is 19 miles and about 9,000 feet of mostly very technical trail. I did this three weeks out from the race, after which I spent my weekends climbing, drinking with friends, and not running enough. To put it simply, I did not put the training in for this event and pushed through on sheer willpower, trekking pole use, and copious amounts of pickles, moral support, and Tailwind.

### Race
This was the first year Run it You Won't was offered by the newly formed Brown Dog Trail Races. They are not new to race directing, but this was their first event after making a move up to Vermont from Georgia. Glenn and Erin were incredibly kind and encouraging during the race and really did a great job putting on a fun and brutal old school trail race. The course took a winding path up the access roads and ski trails at the famous Mad River Glen, with the 6/12/24 hour races making our way all the way to the top before painfully trudging back down. The course was moderately wet at the start but became and absolute mud pit as intense storms kicked up about 6.5 hours in. The route they used was actually easier than the original plan due to some last minute changes, extending the distance and removing a bit of extra vert for a total of 4.9 miles and about 1900 feet of gain per loop. The race team claimed that their measurement tools actually put the course at around 2400 feet of gain per loop, which was backed up by the staff at Mad River Glen, but my Garmin consistently read between 1900 and 2000ft.

The day kicked off at 8:15 with the single loop racers leaving us in their dust as we began to trudge up the mountain. It immediately became clear that the crowd in the 12 and 24 hour races were a lot faster than I had expected, with many of the 24 hour racers dropping me less than 1000 feet up the mountain. The first three laps went smoothly, with the quad fatigue really setting in on lap 4. At this point I was completing loops alone, which made them much tougher. A wicked rainstorm started up as I was coming down lap 5 (I think), turning the loose grass sections of the course into sucking mud. I caught something of a second wind on lap 6, crushing out a fast one, but lap 7 was absolutely brutal. I nearly broke into tears as I was descending when I realized that I would have enough time to go out for one more lap and that I would have to do so for a chance at first or second place. After getting a pep talk from the RD and my girlfriend, I pushed out for one final lap in the pitch black, nearly losing my way several times in very thick fog at the summit. I hobbled down the mountain, finishing my eighth and final lap with about 18 minutes to spare, matching the first place winner in number of laps but not managing to keep up with him pace-wise.

This was my first time ever running a timed ultra and only my second ultra ever. I am very happy with the result I achieved, especially given my young age and lack of experience with the format. The concept of a vertical gain timed race is truly evil and I was completely broken after 12 hours. A MASSIVE shout out to the guy in the 24 hour race that matched me lap for lap (he was actually faster) who was planning on an insane 15 laps (about 68 miles and well over 30,000 feet of gain).

Before that (april 2021) I was moving towards incorporating running into my everyday life (running to and from work and what not). I did survival running, but I want to start training towards ultrarunning when I can run again.
A few things hold me back:
- Diet. I dont eat much meat and carbs. Do I need a meal plan or can I just eat when hungry?
- Eating during a run. I normally run 1-2hours in the morning on an empty stomach. When do you eat (gel or whatever) during a run? Also when you feel like it? Or before that :P
- Strength training. I am not sure what is meant by this exactly. But I hate fitness etc. I Just love to run, and I am hoping you guys Will Tell me I can train for a run by just running. I live alone (so all the chores are mine), work 48hours a week and have a social life... I dont really want to put time towards an activity I don't enjoy.

Hopefully you can shed some light and tell me if ultrarunning would fit my life, or maybe I am better off just running and climbing in survival runs :)

ultrarunning,1634464377,"First 'ultra' completed despite awful cramping in calves- how do I avoid this? I put 'ultra' in scare quotes as it was actually officially a marathon distance but I missed a turned and ended up doing more than 43k. My first, by the way (45M, been training solidly for 3 years)

This was the Monta√±a Solidaria marathon, staring and finishing in El Escorial, about 40km North of Madrid, Spain. 1800m/6000ft vert on technical trails, including some hardcore steep uphills and downhills, stream crossings, fallen trees and some scrambling.

The first 25km were FUCKING AWESOME. The scenery around there is beautiful, I got to the halfway point in a cute mountain village well ahead of schedule. At that point we'd already done 2/3 of the vert and the day was going well beyond expectations. However, towards the start of the final climb my troubles began. Calves were repeatedly cramping, to the point where I had to massively adapt my gait to be able to continue, which led to deep pain on an atomic level for the last 10-12 km.

Thought about dropping out but managed to make it well within the cutoff, but had to walk much more than I wanted and couldn't deal well at all with the final descent. All in all I reckon I finished 45 minutes later than I could have.

As far as possible I'd like this not to happen again, obviously. Long term goals are a 60k next year, 80k the year after. This is Spain so all races at this distance tend to be technical and vertical.",0.064,0.82,0.116,0.9519,1463,259,46,14

if you like Altra Lone Peaks and wish they had better foot hold, better traction, were lighter, had better technical performance, and lasted 3x as long, this is your shoe! 10/10

WEAR

I just hit 600 miles in a single pair, running 30-60mpw, on 50/50 road and very loose rocky trail in the San Juan Mountains. The longest day was 33mi 7000ft 

The shoes now look like a somewhat beat up old pair of sneakers. There are very tiny holes in the upper at the base of my pinky and big toe. The lugs are 90% worn away where I strike but surprisingly still there 

I will continue to use them for at least 200 more miles 

PROS 

- excellent foot hold 
- very grippy, they're almost sticky like a climbing shoe rubber 
- very tough 
- zero drop, wide toe box but not duck-foot wide 
- low to the ground, I've never once rolled my ankle in them, but not minimalist (John Kelly ran the 200+ mile Penine Way in them )

CONS 

- after ""only"" 300 miles the foam was so soft I could feel small pebbles underfoot. I put in the plastic rock plate from Altra Superiors and they were totally fresh again (which is surprising, as I couldn't even feel that thing working in the Altras)! They'd really benefit from a rock plate

\### Training

I'm a relatively new runner, and 2021 is the first year I ran regularly and followed a training program. I began running in 2019 when a friend convinced me to sign up for a trail half marathon (Mount Robson half-marathon), which I enjoyed though found quite challenging because I wasn't well trained for it. At the start of the pandemic in March of 2020, I began running more frequently due to gyms and some of my other hobbies all being closed, though I was only running 1-2 times a week and didn't regularly run any further than 10 kilometres. I didn't run much over the winter of 2020-2021, but I nordic and backcountry skied quite regularly and cycled on an indoor trainer \~2 times a week, which helped keep my fitness level up.

In April of 2021, a friend and I decided to sign up for a 50 mile ultra relay (\~54 miles, \~4,000 m elevation) scheduled for August 14th (Iron Legs - [https://www.ironlegs.ca/relay](https://www.ironlegs.ca/relay)), which was when I began training more regularly. I didn't follow a specific training plan, though my brother put together a rough training schedule as he has an exercise physiology background and was running in the race too. In general, I did 3-4 runs per week including 1 run with speedwork or hills and 1 long run, and 1-2 days of cross training (mostly cycling, some hiking). I gradually ramped up my mileage to a peak of 55 km/week in mid-July. My longest training run before the first race was a 37 kilometre trail run all on portions of the course I would be racing on. I didn‚Äôt do any back to back long runs, though there were a few times I did a long run followed by a long bike ride the next day, vice-versa, or a hike and a trail run in the same day. I didn‚Äôt experience any major injuries or setbacks, though had some knee pain that caused me to cut a few runs short in July. I suspect this was due to an IT band issue, and I used a physio routine my brother had for a similar issue and that seemed to resolve the problem.

The 50-mile relay went okay, though I went out a little too fast at the start, I didn't take in enough salt which resulted in some bad cramping, I had some stomach issues late in the race, and I ended up walking most of the last 15 kilometres. It was also quite hot (\~30oC) and smoky on the day of the race, and I effectively ran the last 30 kilometres by myself which I found quite mentally challenging.

After that race, I had about a week of lower mileage and intensity before beginning to ramp up again for this race. On a whim, I signed up for and ran the Banff Half-Marathon on September 12th (1:36:01) as I was going to be in that area that weekend. This race helped pick my confidence back up after struggling in the 50-mile relay, as I finished with a quicker time than I expected to. My mileage peaked three weeks before the race with 62 kilometres and a 32 km long run.

\### Pre-race

I ate pasta for lunch and dinner the night before the race, and drove to Canmore and stayed in a hotel. I didn‚Äôt sleep very well the night before the race, though I wasn‚Äôt too worried about that as I had made sure to be well rested in the days leading up. I woke up at 6 AM and had oatmeal with raisins and maple syrup and a coffee for breakfast. I then made my way over to the Canmore Nordic Centre to grab my bib and race package. I drank 500 ml of water with nuun in the hour before the race. It was quite chilly waiting around for the race to start, and I decided to run in a long sleave shirt, and with tights under my shorts which I would later regret as the day warmed up.

\### Race

The race was held at the Canmore Nordic Centre and was split into 5 legs each of which started and ended at the biathalon stadium. Due to COVID, they separated us into starting waves based on first name which I thought was a bit odd, but it didn‚Äôt bother me as it put me in the middle of the pack for the first leg which was about where I wanted to be.

The first leg started on a wide paved path for the first few km, eventually transitioning to wide grassy trails for the rest of the leg. Most of this leg was relatively flat, meaning you could run it pretty quickly if you wanted. However, I took the strategy of try to keep a relatively slow and comfortable pace to save my legs and energy for later on in the course where there‚Äôs more elevation and technical trails. I passed and was passed by quite a few people in the first few kilometres as everyone found their place in the pack, and fortunately the trails were wide enough to allow people to do this relatively comfortably. I had a granola bar at the 5km mark, and a gel after 10 km. There were some short steeper climbs later on where I switched to walking, followed by a descent back into the biathalon stadium and transition area in the last kilometre.

The second leg began with a bit of a climb out of the biathalon stadium, which I used as an opportunity to walk and eat a cookie. It then switched to rolling terrain on wide trails for the rest of the leg. I began to notice here that I tended to be slower on the uphills but quicker on the flats and downhills than most competitors around me, so there were a few people I kept leap-frogging with. I continued to resist the urge to go too fast and used walking breaks on the uphill to rest my legs as I knew harder terrain was coming up in the third and fourth legs. I ate some gummies at approximately the 20 km mark, and stopped to refill my Gatorade and water when I got back to the stadium at the end of the leg. When I finished the leg and saw that 2 hours and 40 minutes had gone by, I felt quite confident in my goal to be under 6 hours as I‚Äôd already completed slightly over half the distance.

The third leg followed the same route as the second for the first couple kilometres, and I used the hill at the start to walk and eat a waffle and salt tab. After two kilometres, the course turned off to the left for a short climb up some single track mountain biking trails, followed by a fun \~ 200 m descent all on dirt single track trails. I began to pass a few more people on the descent as my legs felt quite good at this point so I began to run a little more aggressively. Everyone was very courteous with letting other racers pass which was great. After the descent, there was a brief flat section followed by a climb back up along more single track trails. Some of the people I passed on the way down then passed me along this section, as I had switched to walking on the climb while they were still running. I ate another gel along this section and re-filled my Gatorade and water again when I finished the leg.

The fourth leg took a different route out of the stadium that involved a steeper climb out and more single track trails, and I ate my final gel and salt pill during this climb. Partway up, I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention and took a wrong turn and another racer began to follow me. Fortunately, someone else behind us noticed and shouted at us to let us know we were off course, and we were able to quickly correct the mistake. After about 180 m climbing in \~2.5 km, it was another nice descent on single track dirt trails back down towards the stadium for the final leg. When I finished and saw that that the elapsed time was \~ 4 hours 50 minutes, I began to wonder if a sub 5.5 hour finish might be possible.

The final leg began with the same climb as legs 2 and 3. I‚Äôd hoped earlier in the race I‚Äôd save enough energy to run the whole last leg, but my legs didn‚Äôt have enough energy left so I continued to walk the uphill sections. After the climb, I took a downhill section aggressively which caused by hamstring to seize up slightly, though it resolved itself by running at a slower pace for a couple hundred metres, and I avoided running too aggressively for the rest of the race. Another solo runner passed me with \~ 4 km to go, which was great as I‚Äôd been having trouble keeping myself mentally motivated as I hadn‚Äôt seen another solo runner in a while, so it was nice to have someone ahead to chase down. I let her get a bit ahead on a gradual uphill section where I walked and she continued running, and I then caught back up to and passed her in the final descent with about a kilometre to go. Once I could see the finish, I picked up the pace and ended up running the last kilometre in 4:40, crossing the line in 5:36:36, just over 23 minutes ahead of my goal time, and 24th out of 140 solo finishers.

\### Post-race

I grabbed and enjoyed one of the Grizzly Paw sodas they provided to finishers, and hung out in the finishing area for a while. I was able to eat some food too as my stomach felt quite good. My legs recovered reasonably well, and I was able to run 5 km three days afterwards at a reasonable pace.

\### Reflections

\* Overall, I really enjoyed the race. I liked the set-up of having each leg finishing and starting from the same spot as it made it easy to focus on the current leg of the race instead of the total distance remaining, and it meant you were greeted by cheering spectators and relay participants that weren‚Äôt currently running at the end of each leg, which was great for motivation.

\* My pacing strategy of taking the first two legs easy and avoiding the temptation to run too fast worked well for me, and my position in the race at the end of each leg went from 49 -&gt; 40 -&gt; 28 -&gt; 25 -&gt; 24.

\* I noticed that switched to walking on hills at lower grades than others around me, and I was slower on the gradual uphills but quicker on the downhills and flats. I‚Äôm wondering if more hill training might improve this in the future so I can run more of the gradual uphills.

\* Mileage: Based on what I‚Äôve read from some others on this sub, I‚Äôm well below the weekly mileage of what most are doing for their ultra training. However, it seemed to work well for my first summer of running regularly, as I was able to ease into it and didn‚Äôt experience any setbacks or injuries. It‚Äôs possible that my fitness base from skiing over the winter, and my cross training made this possible.

\* Going forward: I‚Äôm quite happy with how my first season of serious running went and was able to surpass my own expectations a few times. Not sure what exactly is in the store for the future, but I do think I‚Äôll try a solo 50-mile race next summer to see how I like the longer distances. I know I‚Äôll have to increase my training volume and likely add back to back long runs to succeed in this, but I don‚Äôt think that will be a problem given that I experienced no major set backs or injuries in my first summer of serious running.

Im 24 years old, and I signed up for the JFK 50 in early May. I had been training very seriously, and slowly worked my MPW to 40 miles about 6 weeks ago, but I began to experience IT band syndrome. I started going to PT immediately, and was only able to run 25 -28 miles per week during the last 6 weeks

My question is this: Do you think I have a chance of finishing even considering my injury took away such a large block of training? I'm mostly healed, but it still sometimes hurts on longer runs.

I've been having questions with my gender identity for quite a while, and I started taking estrogen in late August.

Since beginning HRT, my performance has degraded to the extent that I can barely run a mile at aerobic pace.

1. Caffeine is your best friend

I stopped drinking coffee or anything with caffeine the 2 weeks before the race. It brought down my tolerance. When I finally got a jolt of caffeine at mile 20, I was soaring.

2. Eat and drink more than your body wants

I tried for 300 calories per hour of food and 24oz of water. Electrolyte solution (Endurolytes or Nuun) worked wonders.

3. Don‚Äôt overthink it

The information overload online when researching ultras is overwhelming. ‚ÄúEat this, don‚Äôt eat that. Is Zone 2 HR training essential for endurance runs? Is Garmin the best GPS watch? Altra or Hoka sneakers?‚Äù Just had to get out there and run.

4. Just do it

If you‚Äôre reading the Reddit's, blogs, etc. looking for that one excuse for why you can‚Äôt compete, you‚Äôre already losing. If you want it bad enough, you'll make time.

**Race Recap**

**Location:** Bear Creek Lake in Lakewood, CO

**Weather:** Sunny, 86 F

**Elevation Gain/Change:** 3,240/6,480 Feet

Huge thanks to all the aid station volunteers that allowed this race to be successful.

**Mile 0-12.5:** Easy. Running 9.5 minute miles. Power hiking up the mountains and sprinting downhill. Feeling not even the slightest bit of soreness. Trying to get through as much of the course as I can before the sun comes out. (Can you tell I went out too hard?)

**Mile 12.5-25:** Feeling good. The sun is taking its toll. Race is halfway over. My body has no idea that the race isn‚Äôt really halfway over. *The ultramarathon hasn‚Äôt even started yet.*

**Mile 25-40:** Tough, but doable. The sun is beating down heavily but I find refuge in the aid station spray downs and river crossings. The downhills are worse than the uphills on my quads and joints.

**Mile 40-50:** My mind cannot fathom running the last 10 miles. I haven‚Äôt peed in 5 hours after drinking 120oz of water and electrolyte solution. I am disoriented and dehydrated. Running about 11 minute miles at this point. A dog walking on the trail takes a good bite at my leg. I freeze up and can barely move it. As if the last 10 miles weren‚Äôt going to be hard enough, there‚Äôs now an added layer of difficulty. The aid station volunteers throw some topical antibiotic on the bite marks and recommend stopping/seeking medical attention. I thank them for their help but I am going to get myself to the finish. After a mile of hobbling along and cussing my life, I realize that if I stop playing victim I can finish this thing in sub 10 hours. My hobble slowly breaks into a fucked up stride. One leg in front of the other. ‚ÄúThe best way out is through‚Äù repeats in my head.

I finish in 10 hours and 38 seconds. I feel accomplished but know that I could have found somewhere along the last 50 miles to shave off those 38 seconds. Perfect mix of pride and resolve to spark my training for a 100 Mile.

**The Training:**

**Motivation**

After the initial spark was lit for me, it took plenty of outside sources of motivation to remind me what I was working towards. I bought posters and hung them on my walls. Books, Books, Books. Born to Run- Chris MacDougal. Can‚Äôt Hurt Me- David Goggins. Eat and Run, North- Scott Jurek. Ultramarathon Man-Dean Karnazas. Plenty of other good ones, just ask google. Spotify podcast interviews with any athlete. Audiobooks were nice to mix in when music got boring.

**Runs/Workouts**

Started running hard in May. Like I said, 95% of my training was on the treadmill- 1% incline so I was not getting ‚Äúfree propulsion‚Äù. The pitch and roll of the ship helped build stabilizing leg muscles that your standard treadmill will not. Aside from two, 3 week gaps of minimal running, I logged 30-60 mile weeks depending on how heavy the seas were and what cross training I did. Being on my feet for 12 hour work days was also advantageous for building stamina.

Back to back long runs (20 mi one day/15 mi the next) were helpful to get a feel for what my stomach could handle (GU vs. Solid foods) as well as what sneakers, socks, chafe butter, etc were best. They also allowed me to get used to running on sore legs. I ran a marathon in Alaska 3 weeks before race day and then began my taper.

When time wasn‚Äôt on my side I focused on a few rounds of high rep explosive leg/hip movements followed by core and a short intense run (2-3 mi, Zone 3 HR+).

**Gear**

Luckily I didn‚Äôt have much of a budget. I bought new sneakers every 2 months (Altra Lone Peak 4 and 5), and a new set of Brooks Catamount‚Äôs for race day. The Brooks were by far the best. Ininji toe socks were perfect for preventing blisters between toes. Rei dry wick socks were okay but got saturated in sweat quickly.

The Corros APEX watch was a great alternative to the Garmin- all the same features but with a longer battery life \~ 12 days with constant HR metrics. The APEX died 3 days before the race and never came back on so I switched to the Garmin Forerunner 945 for race day and it held up.

AfterShocks by Trekz Air headphones were my go to mainly because you can still hear everything going on around you. Decent battery life \~ 6 Hrs. Pop some earplugs in if you aren‚Äôt worried about your surroundings and they get even louder.

Squirrels Nut Butter completely eliminated chafing throughout the 50M, cannot recommend it enough. Running with a Nathan fanny pack was annoying but much easier than a vest for me. Grid roller came in handy after the back to back long runs.",0.063,0.802,0.135,0.9973,5475,953,196,85
ultrarunning,1633708883,"50K to 12-hour event in 9 weeks...advisable or not? I completed my first 50K this past Saturday and loved it. It was the Hanging Rock to Pilot Mtn race which was mostly trail, some of which I would call at least moderately technical (rooty and rocky) single track with a few short stretches of road connecting the trail systems between the two parks. According to my Garmin Instinct and the course description, it was about 4K elevation gain. I finished in just under 7 hours and felt reasonably good overall. Had the expected DOMS Mon &amp; Tues, walked a couple hours each of those days then ran a slow easy 10 on Wednesday, 12 today, and feel mostly recovered. I want to do a 50miler in the spring that is also a trail race. In the meantime, there is a 12 hour endurance event close by that is 9 weeks from now. The 12 hour event is a flat rail trail, 5 out and 5 back, so 10 mile ""laps"" for 12 hours. Obviously this won't mimic singletrack running with elevation changes, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to get an idea of what it's like to do a 50 miler from a time on feet standpoint (as well as nutrition, gear etc). Would you agree or disagree? And if it's a reasonable thing to do, what would you do from now to the 12 hour race day? Just pick up in a 50-miler training plan at  the ""9 weeks til race"" week?

ultrarunning,1633638829,"Anyone else like the Backyard Ultra Format? So the last few years I've found myself running Backyard Ultras (aka Last Person Standing) as my preferred long distance race.  My training routine has not been consistent over these years and I find this format works well since essentially you can go as long as you like.  I suppose that's the downside as well - it can be easy to talk yourself out of continuing on.

My third race in this format was this past weekend: Bubba's Backyard Ultra.  I had done this race two years ago in its first year - only 18 people did it and I was the fifth longest runner at 14 laps.  This year I was dealing with some aches and pains and unsure how long I was going to go.  After some rough laps I found a groove and managed to finish 15 laps.  I was very pleased to go longer, even it was just a single lap.  My wife also came out to crew which helped a lot - normally I'm going to these races solo.  

It was a really fun, laidback event.  I love the nature of these events in that you get to know the other runners and you are constantly lining up every hour to resume.  A nice change from those typically lonely ultras.  The size of the field this year had grown considerably to 66 runners and an impressive number went deep into the night.  The final two ended up doing 44 and 45 laps respectively.  A very impressive showing.  Wish I could have stayed to watch them finish but we had to get home after the 24 hour lap.

ultrarunning,1633549828,"Tweaking a training plan to fit a weird work schedule? I just completed my first 50k this past Sunday and finished more or less in the timeframe I wanted, more importantly I finished in a good mood. That being said, I did blow myself up a bit by mile 18-23 by starting too fast and not walking enough early. I immediately signed up for a 40 miler in February, which should be enough time for recovery (read easy running) and training.

For the 50k I didn't really follow a plan and I felt it come about mile 23 (which was 3 miles longer than my longest training run). I have Hal Korner's guide to ultra running that I've referenced before, but the problem is that my work schedule doesn't really fit with the plans in the book. I work 6 days with one day off and 4 with 3 days off so I can't do the prescribed long weekend runs every other week. Could I shuffle the mileage around so that I get the same cumulative mileage week to week or are there other plans out there that would work?

Last night I was scheduled to do 17 miles after having run 10 miles the night before. This would have been the longest run I‚Äôve ever done. The 10 miles  the night before felt great and to be honest the first 9 or so miles of last nights run did too. However, somewhere around mile 10 I started to get an ache in my left knee that got progressively worse very quickly. Around mile 12 I was still thinking I‚Äôm just going to push through this but at 13.2 miles, with my knee periodically giving out and my hamstrings and entire chain of muscles on that leg starting to cramp up due to compensation, I decided to call it quits.

Goal 2: 12hrs       Achieved: Yes

&amp;#x200B;

**PRE-RACE:**

Thursday night I was able to manage 8h30m of sleep, which was great because I knew that there was a chance I would not sleep Friday night (the night before the race). Friday came along and I drove to Boise with my crew (two others) and picked up the race packet and ate a huge serving of Thai Drunken Noodles. After this we went to the house and I put my head down at about 10pm and just like I thought (self-fulfilling prophecy, maybe?) I didn't sleep at all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We left the house around 4:30am for a 5am start at a location about 15 minutes away. On the way there my friend said, ""oh, so they give you your bib at the start?"" and my stomach dropped as I realized what I had done. It was all there. Everything in one pile and I *still* managed to forget the bib! So, we turned around and sped back to the house and miraculously made it to the starting line at 4:58...whew!

&amp;#x200B;

**RACE:**

The course profile immediately starts with a climb and then sort of oscillates for about 15 miles. The best part about this section (and arguably the whole race) was turning the headlamp off for a minute and turning around to see the city lights and all the other runner's headlamps bobbing up and down. Truly amazing.

I reached the first crew-access aid station at mile 15, which was about 40 minutes before I thought I would be there and thankfully I gave the crew an hour window, so they were there and I was able to restock on dried mangos, Swedish Fish, a 'Perfect' bar, and some water &amp; Tailwind from the aid station (I also snuck in some pickles). With the next crew-access aid station at mile 29 I made sure to stock up. I was feeling great, but I also knew that would change in this next leg if my training told me anything. And it did.

From miles 15-32 you just climb. It's steep in some places, but for the most part is gentle. At around mile 19 I started to feel it in my legs a bit and the pain was introduced (and welcomed with a smile!) and so I took it a bit easy going up knowing that I needed to conserve. At mile 22, though, there is a dip in the profile. I am pretty strong at downhills so I took advantage of this and gained some good ground; and it was here where I learned something: *the pain goes away*. By the time I hit the bottom of the dip I felt great and I ran the rest of the way up to the mile 29 aid station with ease. In fact, I was 30 mins away from my estimated window (1hr.30 mins ahead of my estimated time), so my crew hadn't even shown up yet! I knew that this could mess with my head a bit if I let it, but chose to look at it as an opportunity to adapt. I had to rely on the aid station calories, which I had not trained with and was wary to try; but alas a shoved what I could into my pack and ate an Uncrustable PB&amp;J and off I went to finish the final 3 miles of the climbing.

At mile 30 the terrain turns into a forest road before it cuts you off onto a trail for the rest of the descent. Just before mile 32 when I am on the road a car horn honks behind me. Guess who? My crew! They had found me and pulled in front of me and threw out the works on the ground...finally I had mangos and Swedish Fish back in the mix.

The drop down was incredible. Up until this point there had been a lot of exposure, but this part of the course is full of fall colored trees and little streams. I flew down this portion and had so much fun. The descent ends at mile 39, where a mini aid station is set up. At this point I was a little under 8 hours...okay maybe I can break 11(?)...yep, this is the new goal. Once I hit this point I did an evaluation and my stomach was a little upset (maybe from the Uncrustable?) and my feet needed some care. I threw some electrolyte in one of my waters for the stomach and quickly applied some lube to my feet. Back in business!

Next are a couple of climbs and descents until mile 46, where there is another crew access aid station and I felt great going into this. (I did catch up with my crew and my voice is starting to crack, have an of you experienced this?). I filled up on water and was on my way to finish. The race is actually 52.5 miles and in the last 6.5 miles there is an down-up until 48.5 and then down from there. The first down was fine, but then the climb is the steepest of the entire race and I learned something else: *the pain just took a vacation* :) It came back with a vengeance and on the final downhill it was all I could do to maintain a 10:30 minute mile.

The last 1/5 mile is on pavement and the RD threw a nice, steep staircase up to that last 1/5 (honestly this was comedic at this point). Finished strong with a time of 10:53, which ended up being about 1h10m ahead of my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

**POST RACE:**

It was really difficult to put down solid food the night of and continues to be difficult three days later. This concerns me a bit. Has anyone experienced this? I have been able to eat, but not much at a time and it upsets my stomach.

I had chills the night after, but these went away 2 days post-race. (I was tested for Covid and am negative). Has anyone experienced this?

&amp;#x200B;

**REFLECTIONS:**

I was on top of my nutrition. In training I was admittedly sloppy with how much I fueled up, which quite possibly was the reason I was able to get through the pain half way through the race so easily. As noted, I had dried mangos, Swedish Fish, 'Perfect Bar' (to prevent sugar crash). In addition to this I had chocolate covered berries with almonds and some granola. I used the Tailwind at the AS, as well.

I definitely need to rethink how I estimate my times, but given that this was my first 50 miler I think that it was reasonable to be that far off.

Someone on here a while ago likened the brain in these races to the child in the back seat asking, ""are we there yet?"". The thoughts never really became problematic until the end and that idea helped pull me out. You just rely on your legs to do what you have trained them to do and you hope that they memorized the movement. Also, talking to the legs as if they're little separate humans attached to your torso can really help.

Attach bib to shirt the night before :)

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

Well, long post so if you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope that it was a good report (first one I have done).

I will say that this community helped me out tremendously and thank you all for that. Seriously.

I have seen *countless* posts on here asking something along the lines of, ""should I run an ultra...?"" or ""should I run a 50 miler...?"" Look, if you have done the training, then the answer is emphatically, yes! Just do it because I could have thought of any excuse not to and I did so much better than I thought I would and I am so glad I did it. I had an minor ankle injury 1 month pre-race and caught myself trying to use it as an excuse to maybe not do the race. Put those thoughts to rest (if you know they're escape tactics).

ultrarunning,1633374291,"The Things I Learned from my First 100 Miler I ran the YETI100 on 9/24/2021.  My first 100 miler.  I had set a goal to finish in under 24hrs and met that goal, but not exactly as I wanted to.  Secretly, I was hoping for a 20-21 hour finish, but it just didn't happen.  My total moving time though was 21hrs and 10 mins, so if we take out various stops I sort of came close to the 21 hour goal (in a way).  


I had no blisters, I had no chaffing issues, I really had no issues much other than puking at miles 45.7 and 71.7.  I never felt the desire to quit or bail out.

What I learned:

1. Go with the lightest shoes you can find that give you the most comfort.  I wore HOKA Bondi7's, but the fact is, they are too heavy.  I could've done much better with a lighter shoe, if it gave me decent support and comfort.
2. Take advantage of aid stations with ramen/broth/soup - especially at night or late in the day when it starts cooling off.  If nothing else, you get a good dose of sodium.
3. I packed the first 33 miles of nutrition in my vest so that I only had to stop to refill with water.  I ended up stopping at mile 16 or so at the Damascus aid station to take off my long sleeve shirt and stash it with my drop bag.  I had my accessible pockets stuffed with the first 16-20 miles, and the remainder was in a ziploc bag in the back of the vest.
4. Nutrition desires/needs will change after mile 60 - in my case I used less of my pre-prepared ziploc bags of nutrition, and used more of the aid station stuff (as mentioned above - ramen, soup, broth, potatoes, and a little Coke)
5. The weather was perfect, but cooler than the weather I had trained in.  So the first 16 miles, I probably peed 5 times - not a major issue, but it slows you down and you lose time
6. At mile 49 I wanted to change shoes/socks/clothes, re-lube, use a bath-wipe to wash off a bit, etc.  All of that takes more time than you think it will when you are 49 miles in. I had planned on 10-15 mins, and that stop for me was my longest aid station stop by far at 49 minutes - ridiculously long.  But, that's when I also got my first dose of ramen/broth and saw the benefits.  So not all bad.
7. The last 10 miles I was pretty much power walking at 15:00/mi pace or faster.  Others around me were doing a run/walk scenario, yet they weren't really gaining ground.  They would run, disappear into the night, and then at some point 6-8 minutes later they would start walking, and what I noticed was that I was right back on their heels, losing very little or no ground to them overall.  So think about that if you are still trying to run/walk in the late stages. If you are not truly putting distance between you and someone behind you, or you aren't really helping your overall pace, think about the energy you are expending.  Like I said, I didn't finish the way I wanted to, I would have rather ran that last 10 miles or a run/walk scenario, but I made the choice to powerwalk just based on what I was seeing with the people around me.  I was gassed at that point, and I knew I was going to meet my goal - your goal may be different.
8. Puking - for me, I felt better after.  1 minute of recovery time and going again. Your mileage may vary.

All in all, my YETI100 experience was great.  I loved it. The entire day was awesome, and I learned and adjusted as  I went along, and for me it was just a great experience.  Probably one of the top 10 days of my life, and I don't say that lightly.

Long story short, finished with a 22:28 in high spirits, being able to run/walk the last 25 with no major issues AND could keep down solid foods the entire race. 

Key takeaways: 

Coming down from altitude to a flat course, I should have probably taken it a bit slower the first 10k or so - got caught up just talking and wasn't paying attention

Humidity sucks. Like holy shit, I felt like I was overheating during the day, and kept going through 1L of water every 75 minutes or so. 

Dunking my food in chicken noodle soup made all of the food go down SO much easier

Aid stations at Hennepin were the bomb. Pizza rolls, tacos, grilled cheese, pulled pork, pancakes and sausage, brownies -- I constantly found something that sounded appetizing. Baffled me how sparse Leadville was in comparison. 

Someone at mile 35 told me about the 4-1 race plan - run 4, walk 1. Totally adopted this, adjusting it as time went on to 3:30/1:30, 3/2, and then 2:30/2:30 the last 2 hours. By only looking at my lap time (between aid stations) and not the overall time or distance, I was able to concentrate on easy to manage numbers that mentally I could rock. 

My only real pain was from my shoes (feet swelling), and my hip flexors being sore. Didn't have issues with either at Leadville, so that was a surprise.

Is this a bad idea? I've heard folk saying it's really difficult to clean but that was in reference to nutrition powders, which are generally a lot thicker.

And if I do, how much should I put in? ie if one tablet is for 500ml and the bladder is 2 liters I'm guessing I don't want to put in a full four? This will be my primary water source afterall.

I signed up for the Rim to River 100 miler in West Virginia on November 5th, about 9 months ago.  Training has been going great.  No injuries, slowing increasing mileage, practicing race day strategies, nutrition pretty on point etc.  This will be my first Ultra, although I'm not completely new to long distance events (see below).  

A bit of a background on me.  I am a strength and conditioning coach for a military unit.  I regularly ruck with them on Fridays.  They vary in mileage with the shortest being 4 miles and the longest was a 32 hour overnight ruck with a 60 pound ruck.  We went 20+ miles.  Beyond the rucking I strength train with the guys and girls multiple times a week.  I'm fairly lucky that this is literally my job, so it affords plenty of time outside of work to rest and recover, while in addition, I can use any recovery modalities the military has (ice baths, game ready, float tanks, sauna etc.). 

About a week ago out, seemingly out of the blue my IT band flared up.  Like pretty bad.  I read a lot of posts on here that said basically get off your feet, don't push through.  So I've just been taking it easy for the past week.  I didn't even cycle or bike, as I figured some absolute rest for a week would do me good.  I was about to start tapering anyway, so I figured that would be the best route.  I tried to do a slow job yesterday and it flared up pretty good right out the gate.  I cut the jog off at about half a mile, stretched then got in the ice tub.  

Pulling out is not an option.  I have flights, rental cars, hotels for myself, wife and my crew.  What's my best course of action moving forward?  Think the IT band will recover by then?  Cycle and row to keep the cardio up?  Continue to strength train as tolerated to keep some muscle up on the legs?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0.02,0.825,0.155,0.9944,1951,389,46,28

ultrarunning,1632732641,"Weight loss three weeks out from first Ultra? Hi All,

Apologies I wrote this and added a load of context. I've add the question into a tl:dr but left the sprawling context as it might help explain where I'm at fitness and prep wise.

**TL:DR:** Is it worth trying to cut some weight during tapering or is that just going to hurt me?

I'm three weeks out from my first Ultra, Edinburgh Rat Race which is 55km throughout Edinburgh. It's mostly road but there's a small section up into the Pentlands Hills near the start. That's proper hill walking territory but it's all fairly well worn routes and nothing too insane. I've been up there a couple of times and we plan to walk that section since neither me nor the friend I'm running with are experienced trail/fell runners but we've both done plenty of hiking in our time. (As a side tangent my main experience trail/fell running was trying to do a 25 mile charity race through those hills with minimal training and vivobarefoot road shoes, in hindsight I'm not sure how I didn't break myself üòÖ). 

I started my training a bit late but have caught up ok. It's my first Ultra but I've done a couple of Marathon distances before and plenty of halfs. I also run everyday and was doing 4 miles a day for most of lockdown. So while this has definitely been a huge step up I had a decent base. I'm also doing it with a friend and our aim is just to finish within the 10 hour cutoff. So we're planning to walk large sections (most of the trails in the Pentlands) and take our time. I've also recently become a convert to walk/run/walk as a technique and that's helped massively with distance training.  


Anyway to my actual question. After lockdown I'm the heaviest I've ever been, still slimish but upto \~85kg at 186cm. Some of the gain is muscle but a big chunk is belly fat. I considered trying to trim down earlier in training but I'd just started ADHD meds that suppressed appetite (a new sensation for me!) and figured trying to cut weight while getting used to an artificially low appetite and training hard was too risky. I'm used to them now and only have one more long run next weekend before I taper for two weeks. Would it be worth trying to slim down in that time? Or would any weight loss be more than offset by the performance loss of not getting enough fuel in me to recover and build up glycogen stores?",0.078,0.837,0.085,0.7515,2365,434,55,24

*(I created a reddit account to post this trip report - apologies in advance for any formatting issues!)*  


Despite the resurgence of ultramarathon races post 2020-season cancellations, venturing out to Killarney to run the full La Cloche Silhouette trail has maintained a constant pull on my running ambitions. La Cloche was the trail that ignited my passion for backpacking, which leant itself to climbing, then to alpinism, to hobby-jogging when climbing gym closed due to the pandemic, to serious ultra-running and racing. Now, having just completed running La Cloche in its entirety, I find myself back where I began, the same yet entirely different.

Running La Cloche felt like the end of an early chapter in my outdoor pursuits; something that remained unfinished before moving on to bigger things. I‚Äôve done my best to recount my experience in hopes that it might inform ‚Äì or perhaps inspire? ‚Äì others who seek to do the same.

  
**Trip Report**

Anticipation and angst meant I didn‚Äôt hit snooze when my 4 a.m. alarm nagged me out of my sleeping bag. After a cup of coffee, two leftover pancakes from the previous night‚Äôs breakfast-for-dinner (highly recommended), and a reluctant shedding of my warm puffy, we started the running watches\* and set out at 4:50 a.m. from George Lake‚Äôs campsite 30, fittingly the single farthest point from the eastern trailhead of the La Cloche Silhouette Trail. 

*(\*in a rather pointless attempt at good style, we ran a true loop: campsite to campsite rather than the usual east trailhead to west trailhead loop, adding a few kilometres)* 

We began the trail in a counterclockwise fashion, allowing early egress on day-hiking side trails should any nagging injuries rear their ugly head (such options do not exist after the first third of the trail). The goal was not to gun for a fast completion time, nor the vaunted FKT, but to get it done in good style and get back to camp without allowing misery to completely take over our day. 

Upon starting the trail proper, we immediately had to contend with the difficulty of navigating La Cloche‚Äôs characteristic mix of granite slab and deep forest by headlamp. After a brief acclimatization (and some fresh headlight batteries), we were well on our way to the Crack, travelling quickly on reasonably runnable terrain. We arrived at the top of the Crack at sunrise, where we were surprised and disheartened to see a number of hammock campers had spent the night.

The reality of the rest of the trail to come set in once we left the Crack. Terrain and trail conditions suitable to fast travel became a distant memory, replaced by sudden and relentless transitions between steep ascents and descents on generally very rocky, rooted singletrack. The mental concentration required to move quickly on such terrain proved to be the real crux of the day, as the challenge rarely let up from this point onward.

We were granted a short break in the form of a brief portion of runnable double-track on the way to the Silver Peak side trail junction. Feeling strong, adventurous, motivated and a little stupid, we elected in a split second decision to add the Silver Peak side trail to our loop. We ascended, tagged the summit, inhaled a few PB&amp;Js, and descended in well under and hour, and continued our loop. The views at the top were well worth the climb, as was the change of pace from the relentless mental grind of the rugged forest trails. While grateful for the brief diversion, we joked the added elevation might come back to haunt us.

The next 20 kilometres were as beautiful as they were relentless. Dangerously root-y forested sections were punctuated by stunning exposed granite ridges, which offered short glimpses of fast travel. The direct sun on the high slabs was punishing, but we were treated to the occasional refreshing northern gust of wind as we traversed the more exposed parts of the La Cloche high ridge. This section was perhaps most defined by the steep ascent up Moose Pass, where distant trail markers leered at us from above tall sections of exposed granite, with no clear path or direction other than ‚Äúup‚Äù.

As we exited the Hansen Township section and entered Threenarrows, I had my first and thankfully only moment of deep-seated worry, as my outer thighs began threatening to cramp, causing my stride to stiffen. In turn, my now-awkward stride quickly brought on a sharp inner knee pain each time my left foot hit the ground. Thankfully, something in the cocktail of salt pills, ibuprofen and water I nervously sucked back kept the potential injury at bay. The potentially disastrous ramifications of an injury so far into the backcountry were jarring, despite the degree to which we had prepared for such a moment. To be 55 kilometres into an attempt to run the La Cloche loop is to be truly alone, and to be there worrying about injury without true shelter only made the feeling more exposed and sobering. 

The remainder of the run was blissfully uneventful, though our mental fortitude began to give way to regular distance check-ins and the occasional muttered complaint as we closed in on the final 20 kilometres back to camp. As we tired, turn-offs and trail markers were missed, backtracks were more frequent, and morale was tested. The terrain remained too technical to run with any consistency, forcing us to run where possible only to give up after a few hundred meters in favour of a feverish-yet-laboured power hike.

In the final few kilometres, familiar sights and the ever-closer promise of the comfort of our campsite kept the pace quick (or at least it felt quick at the time), and after a quick fist-bump on the bridge that marked the western trailhead, we speed-shuffled back to our distant campsite, quietly cursing our idealized full loop from campsite to campsite idea. We arrived back at camp 16 hours after we left for a total distance of 82.59 kilometres and a total elevation gain of a whopping 3,267 meters.

I can hardly remember eating dinner, and I certainly can‚Äôt remember falling asleep.

Yes, I would do it again.

**Thoughts on Gear**

On to the fun stuff. Gear selection for this attempt was subject to much scrutiny, but the final decisions proved to work in a general sense.

VJ Ultras were the shoe of choice for this run, given their ideal balance between cushion and ground feel and their emphasis on grip for potentially slick granite slab, wet roots, and classic Killarney clay-rich mud. They performed admirably ‚Äì especially on wet terrain ‚Äì despite my relative lack of experience with them (I had only put 50 kilometres on them prior to La Cloche). 

The Salomon Sense Pro 10 was the vest of choice for this run. A 10 litre capacity vest for an unsupported 80+ kilometre run was certainly a risk, but with careful packing and plenty stored in the front pockets, it proved adequately roomy. Comfort was excellent despite humid, sweaty conditions through a very long day on the trail. I used the standard Solomon soft flasks, topped with dual Salomon XA filters for quick water filtration on trail ‚Äì this setup was crucial in order to minimize wasted time actively filtering water. I carried a third, empty Salomon soft flask in the main vest pocket to fill and carry through longer sections that were without reasonable expectation of water access, though this proved unnecessary and the third flask was never used.

Layers were simple, and brought to you by a well-timed Patagonia sale: A Patagonia Capilene baselayer, coupled with a (seldom-used) Airshed Pullover for wind and light precipitation. While shorts may not seem like a gear choice worthy of discussion, I should call out Patagonia‚Äôs now-discontinued Endless Run hybrid short/tight for stellar all-day comfort and truly excellent pockets. For long efforts like these, the chafe protection and ample storage make them worth the increased weight over a pair of split shorts. Fair warning ‚Äì they look stupid as heck.

Nutrition was a case of ‚Äúif it isn‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù. Tailwind, stroopwafels and (caffeinated) Endurance Taps made up the bulk of my calorie intake. A peanut butter &amp; jam (no one likes jelly) sandwich and some salt &amp; vinegar cashews quelled palate fatigue and provided some much needed fat and salt, while a couple Snickers bars ended up being the star of the show ‚Äì every full day out in the backcountry needs a snack that you actually look forward to consuming.

Safety gear took the form of a Garmin InReach, a single down puffy and Gore-Tex ShakeDry shell (each to be shared if needed), and a well-stocked first aid kit. Shelter was omitted by virtue of the excellent weather forecast, though I am well aware of the increased risk created by this decision.",0.077,0.788,0.135,0.9982,9177,1483,154,71

What, would you say, is the minimum longest training run needed for a hilly 50k? Not seriously ‚Äòracing‚Äô, but just wanting to get around and have fun as it‚Äôll be my first ultra. On trails such as the one I‚Äôll be racing I am about 14 minutes/mile, so I‚Äôm rounding that to 15 minutes and thinking an 8-8.5 hour finish is doable. Longest run so far is 20 miles (on a pretty easy trail), and I've had several 15+ milers on trails like what I will be racing on. 

Obviously, my long training runs take ages. Which I‚Äôm totally okay with. But I have three long runs left before I start tapering and I‚Äôm not quite hitting my plan so I‚Äôm wondering if hitting the marathon distance on a trail is critical or not. Between running and hiking (95% running) I have been around 40mpw for the past couple few months, which I feel like should be higher but oh well. For the next the long runs, I am thinking 22, 24, 26... thoughts?

Also, after my last long run, I will be going on holiday and doing a lot of hiking. I will also still be running (supposed to be around 30-35 miles that week). The hikes will be fairly intense mountain hikes in the northern Appalachians, probably no longer than 12 miles per hike though due to my old dog, but easily 2500-4000' gain. Due to less sunlight, traveling/driving places, being on holiday with boyfriend, hiking a lot, etc., I'm anticipating not being able to hit every single run and wondering how much this will hurt me? I go on holiday on the 10th, my race is on the 30th, so will a) hiking a lot and running some will be a nice way to taper or b) hiking will be nice but I need to hit all my runs?

The race was going well early on. I was generally feeling strong and on my target pace. It was hot in the mountains (low 80s) but I had been training in the heat in Texas all summer, so I thought things were fine.

As I rounded a switchback on the first major descent around mile 13 (just above upper Fish Creek Falls, if you know the course), I stumbled. I extended my leg to catch my balance and - BAM! - my calf seized up and I hit the rocks.

Without missing a beat, a nearby runner stopped to help me out. Once it was sure I was not seriously injured, he gave up a few minutes of his race pushing my foot back and forth to help work out the cramp, all while I'm cursing and moaning in agony (apologies to anyone who heard that echoing across the canyon). Throughout this, *every* runner that passed offered help in the form of salts, blocks, and moral support. Despite it looking like my race was over, everyone was willing to lose a little time or gear to make sure I was OK.

We worked out the worst of the cramp and after a little time sitting on the sidelines I managed to hobble down to the aid station. There, the nurse immediately noticed what was going on and came over and started massaging my calf while other volunteers brought me water and offered food (my stomach was not having food at that point). She spend a good portion of my stay there working it out with me (and the other cramped runners - there was a theme).

After a slow ascent with my muscles right on the edge of another cramp, I spent some more time at the next aid station (Long Lake) getting salts balanced. From there, I committed to see if I could make it.

The next sections were 5 miles of easy climbing up a road followed by 20 miles of downhill. I managed to get back on my target pace and gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, the few hours lost in recovery were the buffer I needed and I came into the midway aid station (Olympian) 5 minutes (!!!) past the cutoff. Even with the accident, I was still two hours ahead of my time from 2019 - a victory for me.

I tried following a plan to train for this race in prior years, but I ended up getting injured and I really just didn't have it in me to run every single day. So training for this I decided to go at my own pace and actually quite enjoyed all of my runs.

I ended up driving out to the course and did 25km there as a trial run which was the longest distance I had done up to this. Initially I had planned to do 30-32km but the course was far more difficult that I realized. But spending 5+ hours on the course I learned quite a bit about what to expect. 

### Pre-race
In the days leading up to the event my anxiety was at an alltime high which resulted in me getting really poor sleeps. However, come race day, I was absolutely fired up and ready to go.

In my vest I carried two 500ml soft flasks. One with water, the other with Nuun. Stinger waffles, Huma gels, Fruit bars and candy. 

### Race
Conditions looked awful, 30-35 degrees celcius with 50km/hr+ winds or more. But more on that later. 

The first 20km was amazing. The hills are hard but fairly straightforward and there were plenty of relatively flat sections that allowed me to run at a comfortable and relaxed pace. The ~11km and ~16km aid stations were welcome sights but I was not quite desperate for them yet. 

The sun came out around the 20km mark and that‚Äôs where things went slowly downhill. 

I left the 23km aid station with 1L of water. The high heat with the harsh winds made hydration a real challenge. The wind feels nice because it kind of makes the heat of the sun feel not so bad, but it is a nasty trick. 

By 25km I was rationing water. One sip per 1km. I didn‚Äôt run as much because the more I ran, the more my body demanded water. I was desperate for the next aid station. I switched to technique I called ‚Äúhiking with confidence‚Äù, it‚Äôs the walk you do when you‚Äôre at the airport kind of late on the way to the gate - but you‚Äôre not about to full blown run. 

Between 28-32km I decided to quit but changed my mind a few times. I arrived at the 32k aid station at 6hours 30mins. The wonderful team there dumped a bucket of ice water on my face and that changed everything. Suddenly I felt ready to go and figured I could slam the last 18km in just over 3 hours, but the damage was already done. 

I was still able to eat solids. Putting down a fruit to go bar, waffle, banana or energy gels more or less fine. But after this aid station I couldn‚Äôt run anymore. I believe I was just too dehydrated from the last leg. Whenever my heart rate elevated my stomach wanted to purge itself. Finishing today was not longer an option but I figured I could slog my way to the next aid station. 

The last leg I was more or less alone. And one of the sweepers (volunteers making sure nobody was left on the course) came up behind me and we walked it in to the 42k aid station together, it was nice to have some company. 

I was DNF‚Äôd at the last aid station at 9hours and 46 minutes. But really there was zero chance of me going back out there had they let me. 

It was the hardest thing I have ever done and I had such a fun time doing it. 


### Post-race

In summary:

Training / preparedness ‚úÖ
I felt I was prepared enough to finish. The heat just got to me so bad.

Nutrition ‚úÖ.
I was still able to eat solids and had a pretty good variety of foods

Hydration ‚ùå.
More water.

Footwear ‚ùå. 
My Saucony Peregrines ended up not being really all that comfortable after 25km. My left foot was falling asleep so I had to loosen the laces, but that created more movement. Blister city. 

Attitude / Mental health ‚úÖ. 
It sucked for sure but I was in high spirits for the most part. Really enjoyed it.

People ‚úÖ.
The people that run these races are the nicest people I have ever met. I love being a part of this sport.

### About

BMM is held in June in a park near downtown Black Mountain, NC, on a 3.25 mile runnable trail loop (no, not up in the mountains ala Quest for the Crest, Seven Sisters, etc). After some serious flooding a few years ago the course was altered slightly in 2021, lengthening from 5km to 3.25mi and the start/finish was moved to a better location. No real vert, maybe 100-200ft/lap. There are 6, 12, and 24 hr options.

### Training

I‚Äôve only been running ultra distance for two years with a handful of 50ks and one self-supported 50 miler under my belt. For the buildup for this one, in the spring I raced a 50k in Raleigh and crashed hard in some unexpected (for early April) 80 degree heat. I was huffing it in the last 8-9 miles and vomiting. Not a fun one. I learned a lot from that crash that came in handy for BMM re: heat and nutrition prep. (That‚Äôs the point of buildup races, right!) A few weeks later I ran/hiked the Black Mountain Crest Trail out and back (23 miles 8,000ft vert) with a buddy which was a really helpful training run in terms of time on feet + vert. Peak training was between 55-65mpw with weekend moderately long back-to-backs, the last of which was 21 and 17 miles. I was in a positive space coming into the race. Of course there is always a bit of ‚Äúcould I have done more?‚Äù but in general I felt ready to roll. My goal for the race was to get between 55-60 miles in these 12 hours and place Top 10. If the weather really broke for us (which, spoiler alert, it did not) my stretch goal was 100k. My bottom-of-the-barrel, wheels-come-off goal was a distance PR (over 50mi). 

### Race
The day was shaping up to be sunny, hot, and humid. I grew up in these mountains and I would describe it as a standard summer day. 80 and sticky. When the gun went off (10am start) many went out fast but I was determined to hang back.

The middle of the day really started to take its toll on the field fairly quickly. Everyone slowed significantly. (What is mentally tricky about looped races like these is that the 6, 12, and 24 hour runners were all on the same loop simultaneously so it was impossible to ‚Äòrun off‚Äô other people unless you peeked at their bib. Overall I just tried to ignore others and run my own race. When the 6 hour guys finished it was a lot easier to avoid chasing.) Slowly I was finding a rhythm around the course. 

My plan for our personal aid tent each loop was to ‚Äòblow through‚Äô every time (less than 30 seconds), only stopping for a cold water douse and water refill. Then every 15 miles (3x in the race) I would stop for 3-5 minutes to regroup for a bit and fill up on food. And that‚Äôs exactly how it worked out minus one extra 2-3 minute stop I took around mile 20. It was hot out there. Many were commenting their stomachs were struggling. Mine was as well (I had a hard time with gels) but not nearly as much as others, it seemed. My wife was awesome at quickly switching out water bottles, dousing my buff in ice water, ice down the arm sleeves, etc. I‚Äôm a lucky man. My 3 little girls were a fun morale boost as well, running 50-100 yards with me out of the aid station each loop and ‚Äòhelping‚Äô mom. Looped ultras are a real benefit in this way. Crews are able to stay in the same spot and then we all get into a nice rhythm at each stop that point-to-points can‚Äôt do.

Even though I was already feeling pretty good all things considered, it was after 50k/~6hrs was when things started to come together really nicely. I put together some solid laps and gained a few more spots. The lead male dropped with an injury. (Sorry, man!) Roughly mile 40-45 I moved up into 4th but, most importantly, was in a great headspace for the last few hours. As the day cooled off, things continued to click. Even effort, no real low spots. Gels never went down well, but Bugles (yes, shout-out to America‚Äôs finger hats), watermelon, and pierogis went down nicely. 

At 52 miles I did a little math on the fly and figured out I could complete two more laps and still get in under 12 hours. Finished in 11:50ish with 58.5 miles. 18 laps.

Shoutout to all the finishers. I yoyo‚Äôed quite a bit with the 24hour female eventual winner and was so impressed with some of the 24 hour folks running what was my 12 hour pace. Great athletes out there, way to go everybody. I would recommend this race to others. Well-organized and a fun environment with all the tents and personal aid stations along the course. And definitely a chance to go for an ultra PB that is still on trail but less technical/vert. 

### Post-race
A) Recovery: was feeling great by Wednesday or Thursday.  Except for a gnarly toenail blister I escaped this race without any issues. (Edit: a few weeks later I aggravated some ITB issues which have persisted) B) Aggressive heat management really helped me out. Even though 80 degrees isn‚Äôt exactly western states, I‚Äôd learned at the 50k in April that I‚Äôm a pretty below-average heat runner and need to be more aggressive than most and not overcook it early. Switching out ice cold buffs and hats and stuffing ice in the buff, sleeves, and belt seemed to do the trick for me. C) Looped courses can be an exciting test if you relish the challenge of ‚Äòfiguring out‚Äô a course and want to grow mentally to overcome the monotony. I found it fascinating.

### Gear/eats
Nike Pegasus trail 2 (great for non-tech trail like this though my toes ran out of room towards the end of the race), darn tough socks, some cheap amazon arm sleeves, Garmin 945, petzl iko core for the last 90 minutes in the dark, Naked running belt with Salomon flasks, tailwind, Clif gels, pierogis, bugles, mountain dew, and watermelon.

### Training
 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

### Race
 
The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn‚Äôt last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I‚Äôm glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!


The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn‚Äôt taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that‚Äôs what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn‚Äôt quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: ‚ÄúRun Daddy, this isn‚Äôt a walking race!‚Äù


With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 


At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.


I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn‚Äôt affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‚Äòmove slowly and eat a lot‚Äô strategy would pay off.


As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.


The third lap started well, and I saw another couple of headlamps that were on the back half of the loop which continued to grow my confidence. I was moving well in the rain for the first 20 minutes on the shale paths and asphalt, but then I came to the first climb of the lap. I couldn‚Äôt get up the first 10 foot section, as the rain had turned the trail into a slip and slide. After failing to get any traction on the trail for a few tries, I realized the only way up was to hike on the side of the trail, climbing with my hands when necessary. It was still slippery off the trail, but I could make slow progress. As I came over the top of the long, slow climb and into the descent, I realized that running was out of question. I tried to surf down the trail, however I would pick up speed quickly and fell a few times on this first descent alone.


At the bottom of the hill I realized that I had a new problem; my hands were covered in mud and I was running out of places to wipe them off. This meant that eating would be difficult. I tried to eat some of my snacks with some difficulty before deciding to wear my gloves while running. This way the gloves would get dirty, and I could take them off to eat. In practice my hands just got dirty messing around with my gloves so nothing really got solved.


The rest of the loop was a complete slog. The trails were either flooded or so slick it felt like running on ice. Despite moving slower than I had all race, I was using far more energy and was quickly becoming tired. The descents were the toughest part, with multiple falls and butt slides on each one. During one of the falls I tweaked my knee; I knew I could still run with it on solid ground but on the slippery trails it seemed like I was just asking for an injury. 


As the loop came to an end I had made a decision; if the directors had changed to the wet weather course (all gravel and shale) I would finish the race, but if I had to continue to run on trails then I would have to stop. As I came into the aid station I asked about the situation and was given two options: I could either wait around for ~2.5 hours while they collected runners that were stranded on the course and set up the wet weather loop, or I could take a 100 km finish now. My first thought was that a 100 mile race with a 2.5 hour rest didn‚Äôt seem very fair (to the race course? I don‚Äôt know, I was tired) as I would have time to regain my energy and refuel. Shortly after thinking this I realized that after a break that long I wasn‚Äôt sure I would be able to move at all, and I would need to be constantly moving during the break to ensure that my legs didn‚Äôt seize up. On top of that I wasn‚Äôt sure how my hurt knee would fare either. After a couple minutes of internal debate, I went over to the timing table and let them know I would take a 100 km finish. My final totals were 114.8 km in 21:56, and the race gave me an official 100 km finish (actually 108 km) of 20:07.


I left the timing table and walked through the finish line. I raised my hands and I think someone cheered. It certainly wasn‚Äôt the finish I was expecting and it felt incredibly anti-climactic. I was a bit jealous of the 100 km runners that were running down the final stretch triumphantly to scattered cheers. I sat around for a bit, texting the people who were following my race and chatting with runners that were making it back. Stories of people hitching rides in cars, losing equipment or bushwhacking to the closest aid station made me feel a bit better about my own muddy adventure. Once I heard back from my wife and knew I could get into my hotel room, I made the slow, cold 1 km walk back to the hotel.


Overall I‚Äôm a little disappointed with the result. I went to Lethbridge to run 100 miles, and have no doubt that had the trails held up I could have done it under the cut-off time. I held back on my second lap in preparation for a third lap I didn‚Äôt get to run, so it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a true 100 km effort either. On the other hand, running 115 km in my first ultra is something I can be proud of, and I‚Äôm excited to use the experience I gained in the future.

ultrarunning,1631590342,"Crazy foot issues. Anyone ever see or experience anything like this? Yesterday I finished the Teanaway Country 100. After about 40 miles I felt a bubble on the bottom of my heal. It almost felt like I was wearing some nike shoes with the huge bubbles on them.

I checked it out at an aid station and it was so deep that you couldn't even tell there was a blister there. Since there was nothing obvious to do about it I kept running. 

At about mile 60 I noticed this happening on my other foot and the original blister was spreading so it felt like most of my heal was a giant blister.

As the race continued it got worse and worse eventually spreading to the entire bottoms of my feet. The best way I can describe it is like I was wearing socks made out of my own skin. 

On downhills my feet would slide to the front of my ""sock"" and then they'd slide back as soon as the ground evened out. This was, as you can imagine, very uncomfortable. Any uneven ground or rock caused my foot to shift in its own skin, sometimes with extreme pain. At one point I thought my sock had fallen down my ankle into my shoe. It wasn't my sock, it was the skin of my foot rolling up.

Here's a photo. Warning, these feet grossed out the seasoned ultra runners at the finish line.

ultrarunning,1631578690,"First 50k in April 2022 Every year I try to do something new that challenges my mind and body. In the past, I‚Äôve run a marathon, done an Olympic triathlon, and a 3-day 75 mile backpacking trip. My goal is to eventually do a 50-mile run. 
A little about myself: I‚Äôm 42 yrs old, 5‚Äô11‚Äù 200lbs. I do not have a ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs body.‚Äù I work for UPS so I have a very active job. I get between 15k-20k steps a day. Right now I can go run 8-10 miles on demand @ about a 10:00 min pace. I‚Äôm not a runner that wants to podium. I‚Äôm more interested in just doing the best I can and completing the event. I also mountain bike on the weekends. 
With this in mind, I‚Äôm looking for advice regarding all aspects of a 50k trail run. Everything from: nutrition during and after the runs (I sweat ALOT and can get headaches if I don‚Äôt drink/eat enough; and I don‚Äôt ever feel the difference if I eat Gus or gels), training schedules (looking for something that will mesh with my ups job) and clothing (right now I wear basketball shorts and quick dri UA or Nike shirts; because I sweat a lot these can get uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been looking at the Exoskin line of compression wear). I ran my marathon in basketball shorts and ate whatever they had at the aid stations (which I regret). 
It‚Äôll be hard to train daily as I put in about 9-12hrs a day at work. November and December will be nearly impossible to train except on the weekends. Christmas season will be 14hr days. 
I want to start training now so I can slowly build up to April. If I wait until 3 months before the run then I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôll be too much, too quick on my body and I‚Äôll injure myself.

What watch do you recommend for a fellow Ultrarunner to buy? My budget is 300-400‚Ç¨. I would like to pay less. I don't need to fancy functions. I think a battery time is one of the most important in comparison to data.   


I have looked at:  
Garmin Instinct Solar  
My eye caught this due to it looks. The brain due to it's price and battery. I really like it. But - it is missing the VO2 estimation, recovery data etc. I am not sure if this will bother me or not. GPS and wrist HR works good on this model. I will not have to care so much about battery due to its battery saving tweaks when running 12-24 hours runs.  
Price for a new is 235‚Ç¨. An amazing price I would say for a new Garmin watch.

Coros Pace 2  
Battery monster as well, cheap and alot of data. I can get this for 170‚Ç¨, new. What I do not like is it's ecosystem (I do not know anything about it). I don't know so much about how much I can tweak the battery usage. But as I understand I should be able to run 12-24 hours easily. I think it says 30? hours in GPS-mode. Downside is that it's only offered in white. I am not sure I really like that color on my wrist 24/7. Any reviews on this watch here from other ultra runners that are in this ecosystem already?

Suunto Spartan Ultra  
An old Suunto, that I actually already own. It's ok and it has the data I need for running. But yea, the battery starts getting old and I am not really comfortable with the ecosystem and I'm having a bit trouble tweaking the battery to get out more than 16 hours from this when running. That is a big issue for me before next season when running up to 24 hours. But maybe I've missed some settings?

\### Training

I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

\### Pre-race

Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

\### Race

There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them \~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

\### Post-race

Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

Crested Butte to Aspen
40.5 miles

First ultra in the books! Thank you to all those in this sub who helped answer the questions I had along the way. 

The beginning: 
We started the day just before sunrise at 6am, winding our way around the base of Mount Crested Butte with views of the foggy valley below peeking out between Aspen groves. My running partner and I were feeling great, riding high on the energy of race day. We had signed up for the Grand Traverse spur-of-the-moment back in May, inspired by a particularly fun day of trail running. We are not inexperienced runners, but brand new to ultras and both coming off long breaks from running. We had trained hard all summer and were excited to see what we were capable of now that we had finally reached the start line. I knew we were both a bit undertrained given our short training period, but fully believed that we were both capable of finishing. 

Four miles in, my running partner stumbled and tripped, her arms flying out in front of her. I had done the same thing a couple weeks earlier, ending up with a nasty bruise on my knee that had mostly stopped aching in time for race day. I figured she‚Äôd be dealing with a nice scrape and bruise too, but nothing she couldn‚Äôt run through. She hopped up and turned towards me, and I felt the color leave my face. Instead of blood, I saw the white of fatty tissue and bone. She cried out in shock and stumbled backwards off the trail. A couple that had been just behind us immediately offered their assistance, pulling out a much more equipped med kit than my own. Another runner who happened to be a nurse stepped in to help as well. I was so appreciative for these kind and selfless people who I knew were giving up precious time. Fortunately, we still had service and I contacted race support, figuring out how we could get my friend off the trail and down the nearest road. After our new friends had her wound sufficiently compressed, she and I began a slow journey back the way we had came, towards a trail that would lead us down towards a service road. We were both heartbroken, knowing that the day had ended before it had even really began. We ran into the sweep along the way and explained what had happened and where we were headed. Ten or so minutes later, he appeared back behind us on the trail. ‚ÄúHey, I just spoke to race support, and they said that you should continue on if you‚Äôd like. I can help your friend the rest of the way down.‚Äù I looked back and forth between the sweep and my friend. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù she yelled. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, go!!‚Äù Well, I thought, this is not the way either of us pictured the day, but I had to at least try. I took off back the way we‚Äôd came, trying to move as fast as I could while knowing that I risked burning myself out. I was at least 45 minutes behind the last group of runners, and I was going to be cutting it close to making the first cutoff at 11:15am at the top of Star Pass. I had to push the pace, otherwise there was no point in continuing on. I knew I was going to be lucky to pull this off, but I was so grateful for the opportunity to continue and I had to try. 

I only saw one other runner in the span of almost an hour, and my doubts continued to grow. Before the first aid station, a supporter with a giant sombrero and a cowbell cheered me on. ‚ÄúHow far behind do you think I am?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that, you just run your own race!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo really, how far behind am I?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou just run your own race, this is about you!‚Äù  Yikes, I thought. While I did appreciate the sentiment, there was clearly no hope for me. I was too far behind. I kept pushing, finally passing two other women at the first wet stream crossing at Brush Creek just before Aid 1, 9.5 miles in. A handful of other runners were still at the station, and I breathed a small sigh of relief knowing that I was finally starting to catch up. I just had to keep moving forward.

The middle: 
As I left the aid station, the knee I had bruised a couple weeks prior seized up. I limped my way along. Great, I thought. Not even 10 miles in and it‚Äôs already giving me problems. There‚Äôs no way I can make it if this doesn‚Äôt let up. But, sure enough, it loosened back up and I was feeling good again. It stiffened up every time I stopped moving throughout the day, but the pain was always temporary. 

I moved through Death Pass escarpment onto East Brush Creek jeep road, where I slowly began to pass other runners. It wasn‚Äôt long before the trail started to slowly ascend towards Star Pass. By this time, I had caught up to the couple that had supplied their med kit and helped take care of my friend. I kept pace just behind them, finally feeling like I had a good chance of making the Star Pass cutoff. I followed them all the way to the top of the pass, making the cutoff with 30 minutes to spare. We chatted for awhile as we descended the pass, and I let them know how thankful we were for their help. I had 2 hours to make it 6 miles to the next cutoff at mile 23.5, the summit of Taylor Pass, and I had regained much of my confidence by this point. I was still feeling strong and had managed to avoid any stomach or feet issues, my two worries. 

I powered through to Taylor Pass, once again arriving 30 minutes before the cutoff. I restocked what I needed to from my drop bag and headed towards Richmond Ridge.  There were no more cutoffs after this. I could see the Maroon Bells just behind another mountain range to my left. I knew I was going to make it. I kicked my hiking muscles into gear and moved up and over Richmond Ridge, realizing part way up that I had just completed my first marathon. 

I rolled in to Aid 4 at mile 29. I had 11 miles to go. I could feel some blisters beginning to form between my big toes. I should have reapplied Aquaphor after the last wet crossing, but it was too late now. I kept moving. I was finally beginning to feel the weight of the day. I moved through much of the next 5 miles alone, finally catching up to some other runners as we got closer to Aid 5. This gave me the motivation I needed to pick up the pace. I was getting so close. 

The end: 
I reached the final aid station at the top of Aspen mountain at 3:30pm. I knew that this final stretch was supposed to be brutal, descending 3,200 feet over five miles. The knowledge that was actually going to cross the finish line spurred me on, and I bombed it downhill as fast a I could without completely destroying my quads or risking a wipe out. At this point, the blisters were finally starting to get to me but it really didn‚Äôt matter. I was going to make it. Those 5 miles seemed to keep going and going, and the trail got steeper and steeper to the point where I almost wanted to scoot down on my butt in certain sections. It was the only time during the day where I wished I had poles. 

Finally, I rounded the corner into Ajax Park, almost exactly 10 hours and 30 minutes from when we‚Äôd started. My husband, my now patched-up friend, and her boyfriend were awaiting me. My friend and I immediately embraced. It was a bittersweet ending to a journey that we had started together and had planned to end together. I knew I would never have even made it the start line had it not been for her, and I had channeled her throughout the day all the way through to the finish line. I felt so grateful to have made it there and for the incredible support system waiting for me. Fortunately, while she did need plenty of stitches, my friend‚Äôs injury didn‚Äôt damage any bones or tendons. I know she‚Äôll be back up and running in no time at all, and there will be mountains waiting for her. 

TLDR: Trained hard for the Grand Traverse. Four miles in, I thought both myself and my running partner were both done for thanks to a perfectly placed rock and an unlucky fall. After getting my friend to safety, I was given the opportunity to continue but didn‚Äôt know if I could catch up in time to make the cutoffs. Managed to reach the cutoffs in time and make it across the finish line! I know my friend will get her opportunity to do the same.",0.059,0.789,0.152,0.9994,8152,1554,198,100

ultrarunning,1630680480,"Overtraining at low mileage? I sprained my ankle really badly last fall and took a few months off running to actually do my physio exercises, then started building back my base by following a half-marathon training plan, with the intention to use that as my first training block before starting back into my ultra training plan (which starts at around 50km/week) with the eventual goal of a 50M next spring. I've previously used this training plan for a 55km and a 65km race successfully (""success"" defined here as ""finishing without injury,"" not ""smashing course records"").

I was feeling strong and powerful until I hit about 30km/week in July. This was right about the time it got crazy hot and humid here, so I decided to take a few easy weeks, because I could definitely feel myself struggling and my paces were getting slower, along with my HR getting much higher. I did a few weeks of 30km mileage, then took a two-week break due to a vacation (though subbed in lots of paddling and hiking). 

Now, however, fall has hit, the air is crisp, and here I am struggling to run a 10k on relatively flat roads. My legs feel like they're made of lead, and my HR makes me look like I'm an overweight smoker in my 80s instead of a relatively fit 35 y/o (though I acknowledge that since I'm using a wrist sensor this isn't necessarily super-accurate).

Is it possible that I ramped up too fast post-injury? Did I have asymptomatic COVID that damaged my heart? Has some prankster filled my shoes with ball bearings?

I have had a pretty solid training block (averaging 100km per week) but recently my glute has been giving me grief mid-run. After grinding through it several times, I opted to rest this week and have been to see a physio. He reckons it's just *very* tight, so gave me a deep tissue massage, recommended I take some more time off, and try running again in a day or two.

Mentally, I am struggling with the situation and the loss of miles this week. I know that this close to race day, it's near impossible to improve - I constantly tell myself this, but doubt continues to creep in. I guess this is the norm, but some reassurance would be appreciated.

Basically, I'm looking at attempting an FKT (unsupported) along a flat rail-to-trail line. The route only has something like 600 ft of vertical gain (gross) over the full distance and will have net elevation loss, so it's quite flat. 

Since this is the first time I'll be attempting this distance without support, I'm wondering how I should estimate my hydration needs. **Are there ways to calculate how much water I'd need per hour or per mile?** I have time to test hydration equations.

A Google search didn't yield reliable information ‚Äì One blogger recommended 1L per hour, which seemed excessive and would be too much for me to carry. And I can't really go off of any race experience as I often re-fill my flasks at every opportunity as a precaution. 

Some additional details that may help:

* Looking to run later this fall in cooler weather (shooting for highs in the 50s F)
* I'm estimating the run will take me about 12 hours without support
* I regularly run marathon distances with just two 750 ml soft flasks
* Not concerned with nutrition as I have a pretty good grasp of how many calories I need per hour to keep moving

If needed, I could pull off the run and purchase water from one of the towns the route goes through, which would bump the attempt to the self-supported category. This would be okay but I'd like to try and carry it all with me if I can.

I recognize we all have different needs, but I don't really know where to even start with estimations. Should I just triple what I normally take for a 25ish mile run?

- Expecting to take around 15 hours, but only 12 hours of light, should we start SUPER early to target finish before sundown (so start like 2am) or fine to start around 4am and finish in some darkness?

- Packing around 3-4k calories, mix of sweet potatoes, pb&amp;j sandwiches, trail mix, gummy bears, protein+granola bars, electrolyte tablets, drink mix. Any other good items to pack and bring? We can also get some real food somewhere in the middle right?

But two days ago, after being impressed by killian Jornet, I decided that today I was going to run 50km. 

I still had my thight injury but i felt great 

Ran the 30 kilometers in 3 hours 12 minutes, 

Ran the 41 kilometers in 4 hours 25 minutes

And ran the 50 kilometers in 5 hours 30 minutes with

 two 10 minutes breaks  and multiple 20 seconds breaks 

I felt good, and i could hold the 10 kilometers per hour for hours, but my tight injury Prevented me from doing so, but that's no excuse, I don't think I could have done better. I ran low pace, breathing was easy, everything was good.


But i only took 4 little bottle of 90g of mashed apple  wich represent 20g of carbs per bottle wich is not a lot
. Since i had no running kind of backpack. 

I think I would have needed 200 calories of carbohydrate per hour. 


I really think if i managed to do a 50km run in a OK time without any proper training in just 3 months post  big  injury, I'm on the right path 

And yes, it was a mistake to run this far without proper training or anything. I'm not going to do it again for a while. 

In addition, as I had no water on me, I had to stay close to a tap, which forced me to do trail running on the same trail  circuit for 5 hours. 

And i couldnt run uphill or downhill because of my tight injury, Fortunaly i am near Paris and the highest point is 200m.

I have a 50 mile ultra in ~1 month. The vert on it is about 6,000 ft. I did a training run yesterday (long run day) which was 21 miles with about 6,000 ft. At the end of it I was dead. The run was three loops up to a peak and I walked the uphills  and ran the downs as much as I could (really no flats). The third loop I could not stay in zone 2, even on the downs. 

My long run before this was 28 miles with 4k vert and I didn't feel nearly as dead. And doubled up the next day for another 10 miles.

I love the pockets and stretchy fabric, but here are two things I‚Äôve noticed and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

1) I am struggling getting it to really dial in fit-wise. Mainly an issue when I use the front two water bottle pockets. That weight seems to make it bounce. I have to really pull the cord to make the chest tight but nothing seems to really settle it in. Based on measurements I am a medium but not far from a small. Wondering about smaller size?

2) even more important, it seems that my favorite running shirts are getting messed up. Specifically the front right chest area. It doesn‚Äôt feel abnormal to my hands, but it seems that maybe the rubbing of the material on my shirts is running them raw, so to speak, right behind where the water bottle is. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an issue without the front water, but I feel that shouldn‚Äôt matter.

## Training

My qualifying races were from way back in 2017 and 2018 and I wasn't selected when I applied for 2020. Thanks to COVID, I had another chance to be selected in the lottery. I only really started to train for the race when I got in through the lottery in January.

I started with short daily runs in January, but I ramped up to 100km per week by May. I also went to Chamonix for a couple of weeks of proper training and I went hiking in the Alps.

I ran an ""easy"" 80km trial race with 1500m of elevation at the beginning of July, but I had to DNF because of tendinitis below my knee. I didn't want to waste my chance to participate in the CCC, so I dropped my mileage in July and did a bit of hiking in early August to try and make up for it.

Because I don't live anywhere near hills, I ran most mileage on pretty flat paths and roads. 

To give some perspective of my general running fitness, I run 19:30 for 5km and I did one 20km training run with 1300m of gain loss in 3:10.

## Pre-race

Of course, like everyone else in Chamonix, I was shocked and saddened to hear that a fellow runner died on the TDS course. The volunteers do so much to make the courses as safe as possible, but these races are still high in the Alps and can be dangerous. 

I raced the OCC at the UTMB in 2017 and finished in the top 600 out of 2000 starters, so I thought that I could finish the CCC in a similar position or in about 22 hours. My training and fitness was pretty similar. However, I was placed in the final, fifth wave of runners because I effectively don't have an ITRA ranking. This means that to reach my goal of finishing in 22 hours, I would need to pass more than 1,000 people, which is a serious challenge given that the whole race is primarily on steep, mountain single track.

I also had a couple of other disadvantages. My girlfriend was visiting family, so she couldn't be there in person to crew me (Crews are allowed at every big aid station from Lac Champex on). I also picked the wrong shuttle time from Chamonix, so I had to wake up 5 hours before my race started.

Basically, my training, injury status, crew, and sleep were all suboptimal for a race of this magnitude. 

## Race

**Start to T√™te de la Tronche - 0km to 9km**

I started about 3/4 back in the last wave or behind roughly 1900 other runners. I did manage to pass a lot of people in the first kilometers of the race. I heard that there can be a long wait for the first climb and I was expecting the worst given that I was starting in the final wave. As expected, I spent a lot of time standing around and not moving - at least 45 minutes. However, this might have been beneficial because when I got to the top I felt fresh, even if I heard others wheezing around me.

**T√™te de la Tronche to La Fouly - 9km to 40km**

The next section was downhill, flat and pretty fast, but the huge number of runners meant that it was easy to get caught up in a slowish line. Going uphill to Col Ferret meant another conga line, if not as bad as the first. I passed over 100 people between Col Ferret and Anouvaz alone.

Unfortunately, I was having stomach pain through this section and I was really not eating enough calories. At the first aid station in Bertone at 15km, I felt like I could barely eat and I didn't get much better by Anouvaz. Nevertheless, I passed more than 350 people total from the start when I reached La Fouly on the descent - the equivalent of nearly every single person in front of me in my wave.

Nevertheless, I passed more than 350 people total from the start when I reached LaFouly on the descent - the equivalent of nearly every single person in front of me in my wave.

**La Fouly to Lac Champex - 40km to 55km**

This downhill section flew by. I passed another 100 people and hit the half way point in 10 hours. In fact, I was only about 30 minutes behind schedule for a 22:00 hour finish at Lac Champex. However, on the short climb up to Lac Champex, I was starting to feel weak.

**Lac Champex to Trient - 55km to 70km**

People started suffering at Lac Champex, me included. I stopped for over 20 minutes here because I felt woozy and I called my girlfriend for moral support before I started the race at night. The continued lack of food caused me to absolutely struggle on the climb up to La Giete. When I finally reach the water station at La Giete, I sat down for another 20 minutes and ate as many calories as I could stomach. The medic came by and asked if I needed help. I was really showing it and quite a few people passed me here. I was now more than an hour behind 22 hour pace. 

Luckily eating gave me enough of a boost to get moving again and I actually passed a few people on the descent to Trient.

**Trient to Vallorcine - 70km to 81km**

I got sucked in at Trient and I stopped 30 minutes without realizing it. I put my headphones in to help distract myself when I left. The climb was still slow and I still wasn't eating enough, but I had convinced myself that it would be gravy once I reached the top. In Vallorcine, as soon as I sat down, my body told me to stop. I spent 20 minutes refueling here again, but I eventually got moving.

**Vallorcine to Chamonix - 83km to 100km**

Food to the rescue again. I got up and started moving toward the last big climb of the race. It's the most technical climb - lots of rocks and very steep. Nevertheless, I passed more people up the climb to T√™te au Vents. My legs were absolutely destroyed on the descent down into Chamonix though. My lack of real hill training made it impossible to more than shuffle down the last kilometers from La Fl√®gere into Chamonix. I lost all of the places I gained on the climb up.

The last kilometer in was fun because crowds were already out waiting for the first finishers of the UTMB.

## Post-race

Well, it didn't go as planned but I was more interested in finishing than anything anyway. I also don't have any blisters, black toenails, or new injuries, I just have a regular case of DOMS.

It's true what they say: Ultramarathons are eating competitions with some running thrown in.

Quickly, my current state is that I ran a few 50k runs in 2019 but nothing further and nothing like that far since. I've done a few 40k runs this year in training but most are 10k. I've probably done no more than 20k a week total training for months (but cycle and gym a lot so not unfit in general)

Lastly, a ""slow"" jog for me is 5m30 km/per hr pace - going slower (when fresh) feels odd - so do I run the 100km by doing my  natural pace and adding in lots of walks to drop the overall average to make it sustainable - or run real slow?

ultrarunning,1629951389,"2021 Tahoe 200 cancelled due to forest fires. Received the official notice via email. 

Dear Runners,

We had a long discussion with the USFS today. We have been waiting to hear from them after talks last week in regards to the Caldor Fire and forest closures. They have had several meetings about our event and about closures of National Forests around Lake Tahoe. We are so terribly sorry to say that we have been informed today that the race will not be allowed this year. There is no easy way to say this nor is there any way to lighten the blow. You have trained all year, this is your dream. We realize that you have put a lot into this event. It is a nightmare to have prepared so much and be left with so little. From the bottom of our hearts, we are sorry we could not do any more to make this happen. It is difficult as a racer and as organizers to be at the mercy of nature. This is our passion and we wish we could share it with you this year. 

It's heart wrenching to deliver this terrible news, but we hope that it gives some kind of closure and the opportunity to cancel travel plans or make new ones. After last year's cancellation due to COVID and now this year, we realize that this is two years now that many of you have waited to run this race and two years we have worked hard on our end to make it happen. This race requires a year of work from our entire team. This makes the blow even harder. 

Although we are all devastated to be missing the race this year, our hearts go out to the communities hit by the fire, to the many people who have lost their homes and livelihoods. To the courageous wildland firefighters and forest service risking their lives. As much as we hurt from the cancellation of the race, it can't compare to the losses being suffered by forest fires. Although we regret that the event will not be allowed, we understand that it is important to support the communities as they fight this fire. 

Part of our discussion with the USFS was how to mitigate this fire/smoke issue in future years? Even though last year was cancelled due to COVID, just two weeks later those same forests shut down due to fires as well. That makes two years in a row now that the forests in Tahoe have been closed for fires in September. With the support of the USFS we are planning to move the event permanently to June or early July. Those months are beautiful and green in the Tahoe Basin. Even though June can have lingering snow up high, it's usually mostly clear that time of year and snow does not close entire forests like fires do. Snow can more easily be rerouted around or run through and won't fill the air with dangerous particles. We will keep you informed on new dates and changes as we move forward.

Since hearing about the fire and discussing it with the USFS last week, we have been working on possible reroutes all weekend and week in order to hold the event in the case that it was allowed by local agencies and the smoke was to abate. Unfortunately, no reroutes will be allowed. We want to extend a big thank you to Phil Lowry for working with us on GIS and routes. We had a brilliant plan laid out that took many days and long conversations to develop. We wanted to be completely ready to put it into action if we got the OK from the USFS. 

We wanted to let you know as soon as possible. We will take some time to convene as a team and send you follow up details. We will be mailing out runner swag and merchandise in the next few weeks and we will want to make sure we have an accurate mailing address for you. Please stay tuned for further emails to confirm these items. You can check what address you have on file with Ultrasignup by logging into your ultrasignup account.  

Virtual Option for Racers to Earn their Finish on their Own
We realize it can in no way compare to the read deal Tahoe 200, however, we will be putting together details shortly so that you will still be able to run 200 miles, if you like, and still get your finish. Those who ""finish"" will be mailed their finisher awards. In typical virtual race style, you will pick your route, run it, upload your time and be mailed finisher awards. This will also allow athletes in the Triple Crown to complete the Triple despite the Tahoe 200 cancellation. Submissions will be reviewed and there will be some rules in regards to cut off time and route. We will keep in mind that cut off may need to be more generous as some of you may be running self supported or hillier/more technical routes. We will aim to get this all set up by next week.

Lastly, we want you to know that this decision did not come lightly to the USFS and every possibility we could imagine was explored over the past 6 days. We hope to hold the race in future years pre-fire season so moving to June will be a very positive change. We held the event for 6 years before COVID cancellation with no cancellations. We worry that with what seems like more and more fires in the area in late summer and fall that the September dates seem increasingly risky. We also believe that June or early July will showcase the incredible beauty and wildflowers of Lake Tahoe so that runners can really appreciate the area. 

Thank you for your patience over the past week and now as we work to sort out this emergency cancellation. Thank you for your understanding and kindness.",0.083,0.797,0.12,0.9927,5349,999,132,53

A little background:
I‚Äôve been running consistently since the beginning of 2018, and had a few years of lots of hiking before that. I ran my first road marathon in early in 2019, and a 50k that summer. That was a solid year of training that had good results. 2020 was hit and miss while figuring out shin splint issues and generally running very sporadically. I‚Äôve been consistently running all of 2021 and am currently doing 45-60 MPW training for the 50 miler. 

My ultimate goal has always been to race a 100 miler. My goal is just to finish; I‚Äôm not speedy or looking to compete. My idea is to run a 100k around February - April next year, and then the 100 miler mid to late summer (haven‚Äôt targeted specific races yet). 

Does it make sense to recover from my October 50 miler, and go straight into another training block for the 100k? And then I can take a concentrated 6 months to prepare for the 100 miler?

Goal: Sub 25 hours

Results: DNF at mile 87.5

Leading up to the race, I had a pretty solid summer. Averaging 70-80 miles/week with double weekend long runs, cumulating with a 30+20 double 4 weeks ago, with the last mile of the 20 in 5:57. I was also averaging 6-8k feet of climbing/week. 

I spent the summer trying out new shoes, clothes, packs, and nutrition, before settling on what I though was a race plan. 

Race day: Didn't sleep much at all (if at all) the night before. Woke up at 2:45, had my usual coffee and a tiny bit of oatmeal with peanut butter and got dropped off at the start line. Race went off. Legs felt a little jello-y from the start, but nothing I didn't think a few mile warmup would solve. 

6 miles in, my race plan fell apart. My nutrition was going to be Tailwind, stroopwafels, clif bars, and a gel during the run legs (depending what I was feeling at the time), and then pretzels and PB&amp;J at aid stations, along with a can of V8 before and after Hope Pass. All of these are things I had practiced eating on my long runs without issues this summer. An hour in, I had my first Stroopwafel, and my stomach started cramping up and feeling like I was going to puke. I got to the May Queen aid station, pulled out a Clif bar.... and the same thing. 

It turned out, my stomach couldn't handle solid foods at all. Improvising, I concentrated on just using Tailwind and the on-course Liquidy Gu gels. 

I got into Outward Bound (23.5) feeling mostly energetic, having run the first portion with a group that was aiming for the 23 hour mark, right around what I wanted. I wasn't overly concerned about nutrition at that point as I had thought I had adapted. 

I made my way into Twin Lakes outbound in 6:59 making some friends along they way -- My jello-y legs weren't feeling any better, or worse, but I could tell that I was getting hungry. My crew pulls out one of the soft pretzels I packed, I had 2 bites, and could barely swallow it. 

Off to Hope Pass I go. I'm not a great climber, but I could immediately feel the lack of energy (though to be fair, it's 40 miles into the race). I make my way up and over and down into Winfield. New this year (COVID), there is no crew or pacers in Winfield. I end up sitting in the station for around 15 minutes trying to refill by bag and drink from the drop bag I sent over. I was convinced to try the Ramen, which seemed to go down OK (ish). 

On the way back up Hope Pass, it started raining and hailing for 10 minutes. As I made my way over, I really regretted not bringing a headlamp. It was getting dark as Hope took way longer than planned. Made it back to Twin Lakes at 8PM, picked up my pacer, then was on the struggle bus. As it turned out, my improvised plan of Twilwind and Gu wasn't working anymore. I was getting sick of all the sugar. Stopping at the Half Pipe aid station, I tried to down a pretzel stick, but immediately started dry heaving. I was really starting to feel the effects of my caloric deficit. Made my way into the Pipeline crew point (72ish miles) feeling really drained and doing the walk-run shuffle. Someone had an idea to try Chocolate Milk -- which worked! My next 4ish miles back into Outward bound felt pretty solid and I was able to run about half of it. Picked up my next pacer and had a solid climb up the first part of Powerline --- then my second wind fell off a cliff. I had been trying to force myself to still take in the Gu's every hour.... but at that point, even they were making me sick and I almost vomited taking in my 3rd one that leg. Making my way down Powerline, I was running numbers -- Assuming I'd get into the last Aid Station at 5:30, that would leave me 4.5 hours to get in the remaining 12.5 miles -- and knowing that most of my later aid station stops were about 8-10 minutes as I tried to scarf down some Ramen, that would make it only 4:20, or roughly 21:00 miles. 

The issue became apparent though that I couldn't maintain that. As we hit the smooth flats and downhills coming off the Powerline climb, I was struggling to maintain 20:00 pace -- then we hit single track, and my pace dropped to 25-27:00 for the last 2 miles. That brought me into the aid station at 5:45ish - meaning that I would only have roughly 4:05 to run 12.5, or needing to maintain roughly 19:00 pace. While that didn't seem horrible, the issue is that there are 6ish miles worth of single track around the lake, which at the same rate of running the last few single track miles, I was going to miss the cutoff by 30-40 minutes. Compounded, I was unable to stomach any additional calories. 

At that point, I was mentally over. Given I had been struggling for almost 10 hours with an ever increasing caloric deficit since the start, couldn't consume any additional food without getting sick and realizing that I would have to have a significant ""3rd wind"" out of nowhere to even make the cut-off time based on the paces I was running the prior miles, I concluded that I was done. 

I cried. 7 months of training thrown out over something that I had zero control over. My last pacer tried to make me go, however I had a simple answer: At no point in the prior 20 miles had I averaged 19:00 pace or faster for more than 2-3 miles straight. To run that pace for 12.5 miles, half of which on somewhat technical single track and have a climb back into Leadville all while not being able to consume any additional calories wasn't going to happen. 

I won't lie - I think this will be my only 100. While I enjoyed many aspects of the race, the long training hours and lost weekends got between myself and my Fiancee, and frankly, to spend all the time, money and hours planning for it, only for something so simple to go wrong really put a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).

I'm working with a coach and running 40-50mpw with about half on trail. Everything was going great until pretty recently; I've struggled a little on some of my recent long runs, particularly yesterday, and on many runs my total time would be seriously pushing the cutoff time for my 50miler. 

On one hand, I've worked really hard for nearly a year with this 50 in mind. I'd be pretty disappointed to not try.  I don't want to waste my current fitness since I'm not sure what my long term plans are in running. I can stay on the course after the cutoff and still technically finish, even if I officially DNF. My coach says I'm ""fit enough to go for it"". On the other hand, I don't want to  spend the entire race day stressing about the cutoff which might take a fair amount of enjoyment out of the experience. I also really struggled yesterday on a peak long run and I do not want to feel that shitty during the race. Granted, that run came on the heels of an unusual week. 

I ran my first trail races this year. In February I ran a  marathon with 5500' of vert. I finished with a total time of 5:19:15. In May I ran my first ultra, a 50k with 7500' of vert and I finished with a total time of 7:13:57. In July I ran my 2nd 50k also with about 7k vert,  but a much more challenging course (technically and at elevation) and I finished with a total time of 8:02:02. 

Anyway, yesterday was  discouraging, but I have been working really hard. I would be disappointed to step down from 50 miles, but also proud to complete three 50k's in my first yet of ultra running so I'm struggling to make  the decision and I'm just looking for outside thoughts.¬†

ultrarunning,1629234104,"First 100 Mile race Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend was my first ever 100mile race. What an experience it was!

I've only been running since June 2019 and ran my first marathon in June 2020.

When I started running I was quite overweight (30kg or 66 pounds) so I needed to shed the weight before running long distances and ramping up the milage.

&amp;#x200B;

The aim for the race was quite ambitious, me and a friend of mine headed out with the aim to run under 24hours. My friend had quite a bit more experience then me with long events (ran 100k and a couple of 50milers before) and my longest distance was 57k and longest time on feet was 8hours.

First hours where amazing, the weather was nice, we were right on pace even a bit faster then we expected and everything felt amazing. The only thing that was bothering me was my stomach didn't feel right but nothing serious. A bit later in the day temperatures increased quite a bit (26¬∞ Celsius or 78¬∞ Fahrenheit) and I felt it. I became quite hard to keep myself hydrated even with checkpoints every 20k and salt tablets. I sweat quite a lot when I run and the temperature in Belgium hasn't been this high in quite a few weeks.

Still I was feeling great up until 115km. It became dark and we went on the more technical part of the trail. I became very sleepy, couldn't focus anymore and some part I probably closed my eyes because 30meters or so went by without me remembering. My friend was struggling the first few hours but he improved the further the race went en kept me going. 

Then at about 138km there was a technical descent where I lost my friend and had to walk 7km to the next checkpoint where my friend waited for me. From those 7km I don't really remember anything, I was close to sleepwalking probably and It took forever because the terrain was quite technical and my body was really rebelling, stomach issues, legs where shot, feet really hurt etc but I managed to get there. 

Upon arriving at the checkpoint my friend waited for me a bit worried because he didn't expect me to be that far behind. I told him he should carry on without me because the only thing I could manage the last 16k was walking at a slow pace and I probably needed a powernap before I even wanted to set off. He did and really went for it managing to finish the last 16k in less then 2 hours and even ran his fasted km's of the race. I on the other hand slept for 20minutes before setting of and had to walk for a solid 4hours before finishing almost giving in to quit at 158km.

I finished in 28hours and 52 minutes and I am quite proud of it because I have the feeling that it was all I had in me that day! 

It was the hardest, most painful and probably the most fun experience in my life and can't wait to my next race! 

Hope you guys enjoyed this quick summary of my race(it's my first long post on reddit and English is not my native tongue!) If you have any questions feel free to ask! :)

I run with a Salomon Adv Skin 5L - two 500ml flasks and a 2L bladder. I clean and dry on a regular basis, and deep clean/sanitize on an as-needed basis. I've disassembled the bite valves to blast out built up debris. And this has served me well for the last several years...

But my kit is approaching 4 years. The bladder and soft flasks are in excellent conditions, but the valves are not holding seal. The pocket flasks take in air and start to get that 'swish' sound when I run. Worse yet, the bladder actively leaks from the valve at the end of the tube. My shirt gets soaked all the way down to the shorts. This level of water saturation opens the possibility of chafing... especially on my long, long runs.

Apparently Salomon sells replacement valves (though a bit costly TBH).

Recent backpacking trips evolved into fastpacking trips and ultimately to the realization that I love trail running way more than road running. Fast forward to present day, and my first 50K is 9 weeks away. http://pm2hrultras.com/details/  
My primary goal is to avoid a DNF. My secondary goal is to avoid a DFL finish, and my bonus goal is to finish in a respectable time.
For training, I started off with a modified marathon training program I‚Äôve used before, but with more mileage. Meanwhile, I started reading everything I could find on the subject of ultrarunning/endurance and as a result, totally shifted my training approach from everything I‚Äôve ever known and implemented‚Äîtempo runs, speed work, hill workouts and long runs‚Äîto 100% zone 2 training, as I soon discovered that I have aerobic deficiency syndrome as described in Training for the Uphill Athlete. And just like the book warns, this training has been frustrating and challenging, since I have been forced to run at what feels like a lethargically slow pace in order to keep my HR in zone 2. I‚Äôve also been binging on the Science of Ultra podcast, and one statement Dr. Bearden made is ‚ÄúEasy runs are still runs; they‚Äôre not a shuffling jog.‚Äù Yet, in order to stay at or below my AeT, which according to Maffetone‚Äôs 180 formula is 136, that‚Äôs exactly what I am having to do: a shuffling jog. For example, last weekend, I ran 20 miles on a rail trail‚Äîa soft-packed, completely flat trail‚Äîand I had to shuffle-jog the whole thing in order to stay in zone 2. My first mile was a 10:44 pace and last mile was a crawling 14:51 pace! It was incredibly challenging to ‚Äúrun‚Äù that slowly, not to mention the effect on the ego, as less-fit folks were passing me left and right. My average pace for the whole 20 was 13:07 and average HR was 137. I was able to easily breathe out of my nose the entire 4 hours and 22 minutes. And when I go for trail runs, I am forced to run/walk, run/walk to stay in zone 2. I have so many questions about this approach, but the main three are as follows:
1. With my race being only 9 weeks away, how in the world will I be prepared for a 50K trail race with 3800ft elevation gain if all my training is at a snail‚Äôs pace on easy, flat surface? And how will I be prepared to run (or even power hike) the ups at a faster pace than which I am currently training?
2. Another take-home from my reading and research is that zone 2 training allows for a limitless supply of fuel via fat metabolization, and all my training thus far has supported this theory. In fact, I did that 20 mile run on water only and felt surprisingly fine both during and after the run. (I did have Tailwind Rebuild immediately after the run.) Running without taking in calories is a foreign concept to me. For reference, for all my marathon training in the past, I would take in fuel every 45 mins or so on long runs. So when exactly should I start practicing with fuel for a race-day strategy?
3. How will I become a stronger uphill athlete aka trail/ultrarunner if this method of training is keeping me from running any hills at all(due to the fact that my HR jumps past 136 as soon as I start running uphill, so I have been walking all hills)??

I feel like I‚Äôm missing something big-picture wise. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice to offer, I would be most appreciative!",0.032,0.876,0.092,0.991,3716,666,103,35
ultrarunning,1627858913,"Race Report: White River 50M This was my third time running 50 miles but my first time doing it in an organized event.¬†Garmin stats: 49.1 miles (79 km), 9786 feet (2983 m) of gain.    
    

The White River 50 at Crystal Mountain in Washington has boasted big names like Anton Krupicka, Michael Wardian, Scott Jurek, and Sage Canaday. Runners toe the unassuming start line in the shadow of the great Mount Tahoma, the tallest volcano in the Cascade mountain range. I left my house on the island just after two, arriving at the race start as darkness still shrouded the forest in mystery. My hands trembled as I taped my toes and slid them into my socks. I breathed deeply and tried to calm myself, but it was in vain. I knocked back a cup of fireball whiskey and jogged to the start line.¬†    
    

And we were off. The four miles to the first aid station were flat and smooth. The aptly named White River rushed beside us. Runners were silent as we began the first 3000 foot climb up to Little Ranger Peak. I sucked down gels and realized I was low on fluids for this nearly-nine-mile section. Fuck. We topped the 5,000 foot peak and ran along the ridge. I settled behind three friends running together. The woman in front of me was stung by a bee and didn‚Äôt even break stride. Bad Ass. The trail was lined with wildflowers as tall as me. The contrast of their green vibrancy against towering trees scarred by fire filled me with wonder and awe. A quick stop at the aid station and then I was alone again. I floated down the descent and into the Buck Creek aid station. The volunteers already had my drop bag in hand as I sauntered in. Now it was time to climb again. I partnered up with a guy running his first ultra, shirtless with a pack. I winced at the thought of the ‚Äúchaffage‚Äù in this humidity. It was muggy and the breathtaking views of the mountain were marred by clouds. And so began the second 3000 foot climb. I chatted with the runner behind me, A. His inexperience showed and my concern for him was a distraction from my own struggles. Mostly, we suffered in silence. The camaraderie was comforting. It was hot and none of the aid stations had ice. In that moment, I would have traded my first born for a glass of ice water. Halfway up the climb, the aid station was a welcome sight. They had ice. They took my pack and filled it with ice water. I told the volunteer I loved him and asked him to marry me. He smiled and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre runners too‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt wait for A. When I stopped moving, I was filled with dread from the fervent fatigue, the exhaustion consumed me. I had to keep moving or else I would collapse in a chair and surrender. He caught me soon and I offered words of encouragement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù. I knew when I reached the summit of Sun Top at mile 37, I could finish. I felt the relief well up as I saw the cars parked before I saw the aid station tent. I took a deep breath and swallowed the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù I exclaimed to the volunteers. My drop bag had whiskey and I needed it. I dropped my poles, shared shots with A, and sailed down the buttery smooth descent with elation. I had it in the bag, I thought. I powered through my low during the climb, and it was supposed to be easy from here. It was not. The high quickly faded and I had three more shots of fireball and a rice crispy treat at mile 43. A was ready to be done, so he took off ahead of me and I tried to keep up. But a pounding, all-consuming migraine slowed me to not much more than a stumble. The forest was getting dark as the sun began to sink behind the mountains. The river danced beside me, the breeze cooling the tears on my face. I was stewing in my misery, feeling sorry for myself. My chronic headaches feel like a disability and I was both angry and sad. I sobbed. I couldn‚Äôt run even though my body was strong. I felt so betrayed by this vessel of my consciousness. 5 people passed me. Maybe more. I fantasized about coming upon a bear and letting it eat me. For a brief moment, I had enough cell signal to call my husband. He reassured me and told me was proud. He is deployed and I missed him terribly. I missed the comforting hand of my sweet 5 year old daughter, the way she strokes my cheek and tells me everything is okay. How can a small child be so graceful?¬†     
    


When I finally reached the bridge that was just around a bend to the finish line, I sighed with relief. I didn‚Äôt realize how fucked up my face looked from all the crying until I saw myself in the mirror later. I crossed the finish line and went straight to my car and sobbed. I was proud and happy to be done but I just needed to get out the tears, ride that wave of emotion. I was mad at myself for being weak. For letting the pain get to me. After living with it for my entire existence, you would think I would be used to it by now. I have headaches 24/7 and have for my entire life. Nothing has helped and a dozen specialists and treatments have been unsuccessful. Ultrarunning is helping me restructure the way I feel about pain and has empowered me. But when the barriers broke down at mile 45, I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I let the monster consume me.

I finished in 13 hours and made the long drive back home. No chafing, no injury, just one small blister on my toe. The next morning, I emptied my drop bags and found A's shirt in the one from Sun Top, where we shared shots of whiskey. I have no recollection of putting it there and frankly have no idea how it got there. I do remember him removing it from his pack and complaining about how heavy it was since it was soaked in sweat. I must have offered to stow it for him. Ultra ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù is definitely a thing.¬†

ultrarunning,1627849232,"Top of Foot Pain for Last 6 Months Not looking for medical advice necessarily just want to know if anyone has had any success beating an issue like this. 

In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",0.084,0.816,0.099,0.6899,2275,417,46,26

I was told the following analogy about runners (specifically for the Boston Marathon, but I think it could apply to any race). I am skeptical of the story but I'd like to do my due diligence. I'm using my best Google-fu but still coming up short. I'm looking for stories similar to the analogy described below and any sources or communities you can point me to that might know more.

Here's the analogy:

&gt;You have trained for years to even qualify to run... you have come to Boston... you have started running the race..... and then you realize how hard running a marathon really is. So, at mile 16, you quit. You realize that quitting is so much easier than running and you start to rationalize that quitting was the smart thing to do. But there is a problem, your brother also prepared, came to Boston, and ran the race, and he did not quit. At first, you are ok with him running and finishing the race but quickly the guilt of being a quitter starts to eat away at you. You start to badmouth running and your brother in hopes of alleviating the guilt and now anger you feel towards running.  
Quickly you realize that your old group of friends, who are runners, are not going to buy into your badmouthing of running; so, you gravitate towards other ex-runners who also hate it. Soon you are in an echo chamber... you are all reassuring each other that you are right, you keep saying that running is evil, you all talk about how much easier it is to not go running, and only fools would run a marathon. But every time you see a runner it pricks your conscience and triggers guilt from \[not exercising\], shame from your lifestyle, and anger that they dare find joy in running.  
Soon it becomes your quest not just to not run, but to get other runners to quit running too. You start to blog, tweet, and Facebook about how awful running is, it becomes all-consuming. ...You feed off the running hate-fest of others. For each runner that you can convince to quit will provide you the momentary satisfaction that you are at least not alone in your misery. The longer this cycle continues the less you remember the joy of running with your brother and friends, till the only memories are jaded memories of everyone being rude, and how awful running felt.

I'm trying to find these poor former-runners who are consumed by hatred stemming from their own inadequacy to get their side of the story but despite how vocal they are described to be in this analogy, I'm having some trouble.

I assume as runners yourselves, you are constantly assaulted by these kinds of people who have quit and seem to relentlessly attack your choice to run. Please share your stories.",0.154,0.719,0.126,-0.9627,2896,515,36,28

Just moved to southern Oregon Coast. Excited to check out our upcoming race calendar! Less excited to see a weird clump of the few ultra events in \~driving distance coming up all in early October...

* Oct 2nd 50K or 25K
* Oct 3rd 50K (already signed up for this one)
* Oct 9th/10th 25K/50K (same course/organizer)

I almost stupidly/boldly signed up for the 50/50 double on Oct 2nd/3rd. The following weekend popped up in my email just in time to give me second thoughts!

For some context I've done two 50K's this year, plus three other marathon+ length trail runs (two FKTs and a last-one-standing). I was at \~70 mpw for most of the year prior to a relative down July due to moving events, but back up to 50mpw for this week. I'm sure that I could reasonably do a 100K race in October with some more focused training (long runs)... two 50Ks over two days, easier, right?

I should probably be reasonable and skip the Oct 2 event entirely. But if I was to do 50's on the 3rd and 9th... anyone have pertinent experience or advice? Anyone want to smack some sanity back into me? Bring me a beer at the finish line (or halfway point)?

ultrarunning,1627496452,"At the end of my tether with my knee injuries. I'm searching for positive recovery stories because I cannot take it anymore. The uncertainty, the time off. None of the PT's are insightful. I'm not searching for medical advice. Just some support and experience. I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

ultrarunning,1627251555,"Question: heart rate won't stay below zone 3 at high mileage, but perceived effort is zone 2-ish Greetings!  I am hoping y'all can offer some insight.  I am training for my first official 50k, and I've done a few marathons/shorter distance in the past.  This is my first time doing structured training and I am doing the 80/20 system, focusing on keeping 80% of my runs in zone 2 based on heart rate.  My race-day goal is to finish in under 6 hours.

Since I began preparing for this race, I've been focusing on total weekly mileage and before this weekend had not run further than about 13 miles in a single training run.

I just ran my first longer run (21 miles) since I began this training regimen.  Up to about mile 12, I kept my heart rate easily in zone 2.  It crept up to zone 3 periodically and I slowed down to bring it down.  

I did a pit stop at mile 11 to use the bathroom and ate half a PB&amp;J.

After about mile 12, my heart rate went up into zone 3 or higher and stayed there.  My perceived effort still felt zone 2-ish though.  By mile 15, I was feeling not as fresh as when I first started but energy levels were good.  But by mile 15 I could not bring my heart rate below zone 3, even when I walked at a completely casual pace.  When I jogged it went up to zone 4.  It remained that way the last 5 miles of the run.  

From an energy level/perceived effort perspective, my run was consistent with my goals.  But the higher heart rate concerned me based on the 80-20 training principals and my goal of maintaining that energy level for another 10 miles.  

I would appreciate any insight from those who have experience with this.  Is that normal?  At that point, should I focus on perceived effort instead of heart rate number?

I don't think my diet affected my heart rate, but I will mention that some of my nutrition I had on the run had caffeine in it.  It was total 100mg of caffeine, which was divided into 6 portions.  I took one portion (1/6th of 100mg) every 40 minutes over the 4 hour run.  I normally drink 200mg of caffeine per day (coffee) and I only had one cup of coffee so far that day, so I don't think the caffeine would have affected my heart rate.

\- Is it best to follow a training plan for a 1/2 marathon?

\- Or should I maintain my current approach (low intensity mileage), maybe reduce the distance per week and add one or 2 specific sessions per week, and in this case what kind of work is the most efficient for a 1/2 marathon (tempo run, fast intervals, long intervals...)?

ultrarunning,1626902130,"New shoes causing foot pain? This is a bit of a noob question, but I'd love to get some advice.

I'm new to trail running and longer distances. Previously, I had one pair of road running shoes that I loved and wore out after about 800 miles running casually and a several half marathons + training. Then I stopped doing much running for about 5 years once we had kids. I am getting back into running and have been running trails doing runs between 5-25k hoping to get to 50k someday. I've been wearing a pair of a road shoes I bought last year to replace the olds and it's been fine but the trails here have been very muddy and wet and I wanted to 'graduate' to some trail running shoes (only discovered the distinction from watching Ginger Runner). I've been holding off because I don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy shoes, but saw a significant sale at the weekend in a local store and picked up a pair of Asics Sonoma 5 GT-X and Fuji Trabuco 8 both the same size. I thought I got a pretty good fit (tried them in person). My feet were feeling pretty sore after the weekend as I ran 25k on Saturday and the on Sunday I ended up having to walk for a very long time in terrible flat deck shoes. My feet were feeling pretty tired and sore on Monday. Tuesday I took the Sonomas out for short 5k spin. Whilst the extra grip felt amazing compared to running in road shoes (especially going downhill on trails) my right foot (on the top) got really painful and then felt horrible for the rest of the evening. My left foot starting to feel a little weirdly numb (kinda like start of pins and needles) whilst running. Now on Wednesday my right foot feels okay but kinda strained in the tendons on top in a way I've never felt before. I'm wondering if this could be the new shoes (combined with some stress from the weekend walking) and whether this might just be that they need time to 'warm up' / 'stretch out' / whatever to my feet? Is that a thing?

I don't really remember feeling this kind of thing before, but (to my embarrassment) I have only ever bought two pairs of running shoes (seen above). Could it be a sizing issue? If anything they feel a little bit looser than my current shoes, mostly at the heel. There is plenty of space up front (about a thumbs width between my big toe and end). Should I just give them time to wear in or should I try to exchange them (I'm guessing this is not possible since I already wore them... damn)? I'm pretty terrified of getting injured (I had a meniscus issue a few months back that knocked me back and it sucked) but the money thing is an issue.

Any advice appreciated, I'm kinda new to this. I guess till my foot feels better I will rest and just run in the shoes I was running in before which didn't cause any foot noticeable pain (not at 5k distance anyway!) I haven't taken the Fuji Trabuco's out for a spin, but I am hoping they will be different. But maybe I should cut my losses and return those as I haven't worn them out yet (I don't know how different they could be to the Sonomas, they look quite different structurally compared to the Sonomas and they feel a bit more of a snug fit when just wearing them around the house).",0.092,0.779,0.129,0.976,3187,606,70,28
ultrarunning,1626892878,"Creating apple watch app for runners Hello guys,

I am a software engineer who started to run recently. While I was doing my research about running I found out that I should track heart zones during workouts.

I searched for heart zones watchOS tracking apps, tried some, but none of them seemed to suit me well. My requirements were mainly:

* Track heart zone with other workout metrics (distance, bpm, pace, time) in same screen without scrolling, just with glance at my watch.
* Device beeps (vibrations) when passing through zones.
* Support of continuous alert when leaving target zone. Stop beeping when entered target zone again.

As a bonus, few times I wanted to know when sunset occurs as I didn't know if I could take extended route and make it home until sunset. Like some sort of sun pictogram with minutes left, showing 45 mins before sunset.

So I decided to create a watchOS app for myself that will satisfy my needs, which I mentioned earlier. Currently I have working prototype, that I am beta testing by myself. I am planning to add new features, companion iOS app with settings etc.

I had a 30 miler on the schedule for my training run this weekend.  I live in the Southeastern US where we have the joy of both heat and humidity.  I started at 5:10am in the dark at 72F and 97% humidity.

I kept a slow and steady pace knowing that it was going to warm up quite a bit during the 30 miles.  All went well until about mile 23 when I started cramping in my legs.

I ran a 9.5 mile loop, at the end of each loop, stopped and either changed out bottles or refilled bottles at my car, and continued.  Each loop I carried three 500ml soft flasks and wiped them out each loop.

 

The fluids I took were:

Loop 1: 1L of electrolytes, 500ml of complex carbs (250 cals)  
Loop 2: 1L of complex carbs  (500 cals), 500ml of electrolytes  
Loop3  : 500ml of electrolytes and complex carbs (250 cals), 500ml of complex  carb (250 cals), and 500ml of electrolytes, and I took in 1 gel that was  190 cals with electrolytes around mile 24.x

Every hour I took 2 salt stick chews as well.

In total, including the water I drank at my vehicle, I took in 5L of fluids maybe a tick more.  Yet still cramped, and even more important than that - I lost 11 pounds of water weight during the run.  ELEVEN POUNDS.  


So my question is, for others that are in the hot/humid environments, what is your typical intake goal per hour for fluids.  My goal was 1L per hour, which I fell a little short of, next time I will have 2L of fluids on me for a 9-10 mile loop.  In addition to that, what is your caloric intake goal during an hour (yes, I know everyone is different).  


I have a 50 mile training run on 8/21, and it will still be hot/humid/muggy then, and I am trying to plan better, and stay hydrated better, because I felt miserable for the remainder of the day on Saturday.

Some info about me and my route before I continue:

18 years old, been running for about 2 years now, I run about 30-40kms a week right now, but planning on increasing to about 50km a week over the course of the next few weeks

Planning on running a 50km in late september (probably closer to 48kms), by myself. No official race or anything just wanted to do it off my own back. The run itself is very flat, practically a road run for the most part, only about 300m of elevation over the course of the whole run. This will also be my first 'ultra'

I dont have a time goal or anything, the only metric im going to try and stick to is running around 7:00 minutes per km for most of the run. And if I have to walk some, so be it. I just want to finish it.

**Question**: And then what? I'd love to **crush** the 50-mile trail race next summer. But I live in MN where running outside sucks Nov-March.

- Spend a lot of time doing squats, deadlifts, core, and other supplementary strength training

- Try to get my weight down to 165lbs by next March

I've been having a lot of problems with cramps on any run over 22 miles, mostly in the calfs but sometimes in my thighs and even in my back on occasion. 


I'm a heavy sweater and sweat a lot of salt. I get crusty arms and you can see it outlined in my caps, running vest and clothes. 


I ran an ultra this past weekend and managed to keep the cramps at bay but I drank a ridiculous amount of electrolyte drinks, refilling a 500ml soft flask at almost every aid station with either a high5 tab or a Hammer Nutrition Endurolyte tab. Ended up using 7 electrolyte tablets though the 100km.


The problem is (I think) this caused me to have GI issues from about the 80km mark meaning I really struggled to get in any fuel for the remaining 20km and caused me to vomit once (with two tactical chunders).


I was wondering if anyone out there had used their sweat tests to dial in their salt/electrolyte needs and if there were any real world reviews.

ultrarunning,1626025007,"Medical tests to request for cardiovascular issue beyond the basics Kind of a specific question but I figured maybe others here have dealt with similar things and can provide insight.

I've been dealing with what seems to be a cardiovascular issue that comes on suddenly during occasional runs (as in a couple times a year, but is now happening more frequently and intensely) and have seen 3-4 different doctors and specialists over the past several years, and they've turned up nothing and haven't been able to help. So I want to request as much testing as possible beyond a blood panel at my next appt with a new doctor. I've already had lung and asthma testing, full allergy panel, ekg, and blood panel - none have turned up any conditions.

A little background: I'm training for a 100-mile race in a couple months and had my most extreme case of this issue this weekend on a long run (~26 miles) at high elevation in the mountains. The elevation, terrain, some fatigue and the heat no doubt all factored in, but nothing about this run was beyond what I'm used too.

The issue (short version): occasionally during runs (not necessarily long or hard runs) I get to a point where my heart rate spikes significantly while going uphill, even at a slow pace on moderate grade. It got to a point this weekend where I had to sit down and lay down on the trail multiple times before continuing on (which has never happened before). Legs and the rest of my body were completely fine, but my heart rate spiked so high and my lungs felt so tight that I couldn't catch a breath, and I felt this overwhelming sleepiness. I felt like I could have gone to sleep right there on the hillside. Other issues were nausea, dizziness, blurry vision and some shakiness in my hands that was fixed by taking some electrolyte tabs.

This is a very condensed version of it, but it's happened several times now and does not seem to be directly related to anything like elevation, training volume, length of run, overall fitness, etc. No doctor has yet turned up anything. Again, not looking for medical advice, diagnoses, etc. I'll be seeing a Dr again and am looking for tests to request related to cardiovascular or other issues related to ultrarunning and training.

TLDR: heart rate spikes significantly occasionally on runs to a point that causes dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, and sleepiness. Not directly related to fitness, type or length of run, or any other factors that I can identify.

So 6 weeks ago I ran 100km road ultra. I mainly run on trails but due to lack of events I gave this a go. Finished it and was in a bit of pain but nothing major, assumed just normal wear and tear.

A few days later and the pain and uncomfortableness was mostly gone. I ran 10 days after and had to stop after 4 miles due to pain around and in my left knee, (on the left side of it and round to the back of the knee).

I don‚Äôt seem to have any real improvement as I still can‚Äôt run any further and the pain returns if I go over 4 miles. The physio tells me to continue to run 2 or 3 times a week to build it up + the strengthening. Due to lack of improvement..my question is - 

Should I continue to run or would total rest be better?

It is always better to do strengthening work for rehab or would rest be better?

So, my 735XT died after slightly over a year of use, and of course garmin told me (very politely) to suck it up and buy a new watch. So I'm looking for a watch to replace it, preferably not garmin.

==Things I need (I'm assuming things like GPS tracking, a bunch of basic data fields and so on are already in):

\-48h battery life in GPS mode with HR sensor on (Want to use it for at least 5 years and the battery on these things degrades ridiculously fast. This will let me do \~100 milers 6-7 years from now, which is what I expect the watch to last). I would settle for less if the watch keeps the HR sensor on while charging.

\-Solid construction. The 735 \*looks\* solid but I'm really disappointed on it. I want something that lasts. 

\-Good enough software platform (I know this is a pipe dream, but garmin connect is so unstable that I'll take literally anything else as long as I have a way of transferring my data)

\-Wrist HR sensor (Bonus points if it works better than the one in the 735. The bar is pretty low)

==Nice-to-haves:

\-Multisport. If not I'm OK stopping/starting activities, I don't care about this that much.

\-Inline skating, climbing, other profiles available. On the 735 I had to manually edit all activities that weren't on a very short list every time and it got very annoying very fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of cheesed off at the current state of gps watches, tbh. The only thing that matters is the dang battery life, and whenever they upgrade that they put so many useless gimmicks in the things that the battery drains faster and the watch ends up struggling to last for an entire long run after a year or two. I've been looking at some of them and they put a music player in some models. A FRIGGIN MUSIC PLAYER. Sick of being skinned for a tool I need for training, I wish someone made a basic running watch with a huge-ass battery and zero gimmicks. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant, and thanks in advance for the replies. I'm assuming my options will be very limited...",0.121,0.82,0.059,-0.9801,2061,369,77,21

It comes only in S/M or M/L and I‚Äôve gone with the smaller one but it‚Äôs still slightly too big - figure if I can hook to the top and bottom of the 6x tiny loops on the sternum joint (instead of hooking to the 2 x mid-way loops - which is the only option allowed on the pack ATM due to the hook being immovable) then it might feel more secure and less buoyed out from my upper back as is currently the case

Also - anyone tried to modify this pack yet in terms of a snugger fit for smaller torso ppl ? 

Thanks all!

Oh - and I can offer advice about the Fastpack 25 vs XA25 question 

I bought both to try - S/M in both but the UD pack fits much better than Saloman in this size. However the UD seems to jolt around more than the S. Also - huge design flaw with the UD is that the bladder goes inside the pack meaning that u actually have to unpack the whole bag to refill it! That‚Äôs pretty much ruled it out for me - and I‚Äôm now about 90% sure I‚Äôll stick with the XA25 despite being a bit too big - and in the hope i can find a way to modify it to better fit without stuffing anything up

Oh other flaw with FP25 is that it has annoying velcro on the main bag closure so yr woollen sleeves or delicate ultra light gear gets snagged on the way in/out 
And it‚Äôs front strap storage is awful compared to the XA25

But hat off to UD for making a size that fits a medium sized female body vs Saloman who have (in perhaps a sexist, or at least careless, fashion) made the smallest size too big for most female ultra",0.031,0.848,0.121,0.9835,1631,330,50,6

I've done numerous marathons and a few 50's, no issues doing 30 miles during training. I'm 61, so age is starting to creep up a bit.

My plan is to run the Daytona 100, but just do the 50 miler in Dec. then start training for the Keys 100 that is in May. 

I feel pretty good about my training plan, the basic long back to backs, 2 week high and 1 week low miles, gets up to around 60 mpw. I've used it before and have had success. 

The 100 mile training is close to it, with 3 week highs and tops out around 70 mpw. 

I like to dial in as best I can my equipment, nutrition, etc., that's the point of the 50. 

My question is this; based on the timing of the 50, I will have a 2 - 3 week period of basic base training for the 100. Advice on say sitting out a week just walking, take a few days off then jump back in, lower my miles for the 2 weeks and then dive in.

The race will be held in September and it runs for 67k (or about 40 miles, right?) and it has about 2150 meters of elevation (7000ft, right ?) . I have done a couple of middle-distance races before, in the range from 35k to a trail marathon. Those races usually had pretty much the same amount of elevation as this ultra, so the climbing is not something I'm worried about. The reason I came to reddit for answers is because I'm woefully unprepared. I have spent the last two months studying for Uni, barely leaving the house, ever. I know that the training plans and training schedules for these kind of races take at least 10-12 weeks, and I have 8. In the meantime, I have already singed up for some shorter races (a 35k, a 21k, a 5k, and a vertical K), all of which are trail races, and I intend to use them as training, not flat-out racing.

Let's talk about pee for a minute if you don't mind. I hope there are no weird formatting things with this as I am posting on mobile. 

Today, after dropping out of a 50k with significant vert in high temperatures, I experienced what I briefly suspected to be exercise induced hematuria. According to [this article](https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/exerciseinduced-hematuria-va-116.htm), this condition is also called ""runners bladder."" A quick search of the sub finds no discussion of this condition that apparently affects us on the reg.

I discovered this condition during a frantic Google search after the darkest pee of my life. My first thoughts were something serious, but I have no other symptoms and generally feel fine, all things considered. From my understanding, if my kidneys were failing or other serious condition, I would be experiencing dizziness or confusion and likely wouldn't be able to post on reddit or type this up. Until I dove down the dark brown urine rabbit hole, I had never heard of exercise induced hematuria and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this.

For what it's worth, I dropped because I threw up a few times and really didn't feel like gutting out nausea while trudging up the mountain again for the last ten miles. With the coloration of my urine, clearly this was a good decision. If you're curious, I peed only once about an hour and a half into the run and dropped about 6 and a half hours in. My next pee was the dark brown urination about an hour after I dropped. Now, about two hours post initial panic, urine is back to stereotypically healthy color. 

It's much more likely that I am/was just abnormally dehydrated, but, usually, I get a massive headache when I'm severely dehydrated. No headache today plus this is an interesting medical condition I've never heard of that I'm curious about.

First time attempt at WSER over the weekend and it didn't go well.  Looking to vent and maybe get some advice.  Was going OK through mile 45, then it all fell apart for a variety of reasons.  The climb up to Devil's Thumb had me delirious.  I looked at my phone and forgot where I was.  That made me worried for my safety.  

I was worried about that happening again and falling off the trail and dying! Even after ""recovering"" at the aid station at the top of the hill, I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  When I got to the bottom (mile 52) at the next aid station, I sat for about 30 minutes, came very close to dropping because I knew it was a big climb to the next spot. An angel at the aid station convinced me to walk out with her.  

Quickly passed her, made it to Michigan Bluff in the dark, got a pacer, but still couldn't get out of my bad headspace.  Instead of running, I was just complaining and walking.  Made it to Forest hill as they were blowing the airhorn which ended my race.

This weekend I had my first DNF. I was at Lavaredo Ultra Trail a 120km race with 5800 meters of vert. I withdraw after 95k. My longest previous race was 100k with 6100 m vert.

I was feeling too tired and that sounded a reasonable decision. I was scared about having to keep walking for 6 or more hours. 

Now, two days later, I am a bit frustrated. I am realising that it probably was a mental breakdown, I still had plenty of time to recover and then finish (I had like 5 hours before cut off). I am now physically way better I was expecting after running 95k and I feel my training was OK.

A little over 2 years ago my roommate M (23F at the time) got into ultra running. Since then she has run 3 official 50ks, a 50 miler, 100k, 24hr race, and she just completed a 12 hr race this last weekend. She has placed in some of these, and done generally well in others. She is a strong runner and very mentally tough, and I'm impressed by her perseverance and general character. She is used to getting called crazy for her interest in ultras, and I have made an effort to understand her and not call her crazy. I have gone to every one of her races and crewed her, and I paced her for a few laps this last weekend. I feel invested in her running and want to see her succeed. I'm a casual runner, never gone more than a half marathon myself.

However, after training for her 50 miler she began struggling with shin splints and has not found a great permanent solution (she has tried PT but doesnt really stick with it). For the last 6ish months she has geared her training back quite a bit, trying to give her legs a break. It seems to have worked, as she ran a marathon, half marathon, and 12hr race (56 mi total) within the last 6 weeks with no shin splints. However, she did NO training for these (no idea how she did well in these races, but happy for her anyway). 

She will be training for a 100 mile race coming up in September, but I am worried for her. I want to believe that she knows her body best, but I have watched her take 6+ ibuprofen on consecutive days when she has runs to try to control the shin splints. She is not totally honest with her coach about the pain because she wants to be strong and push through. 

Over the last few weeks I have started feeling like a nag. I have been discouraging her from signing up for more races in the summer, and I am scared that she will hurt herself again in the training for this 100 mi race. She is inspired by her ability to push past her mental limits, but I'm worried that she is going to find a physical limit she cant push by that will cause lasting damage. 

Sorry for the long post, but I find context here relevant. Do any of you have advice on how to stay supportive? Do I just have to accept that it's her body to push hard, and I'm not responsible for her overtraining?

Tried doing over 50 mpw too fast. Now both my knees hurt and have done for three weeks. Can't see a PT or doctor at the moment. They hurt whenever I try running, and will hurt when sat down.

I'm hoping it is a cartilage issue, apparently a variety of runners knee where the cartilage softens and might need six week to heal. This theory of mine is strengthened by the fact the pain doesn't seem to be localized, it seems to be inside the knee but across the whole cross section of the knee, which is pretty much where cartilage is.

The knee tracks out of alignment with muscle imbalances and this can cause issues with healing apparently.

How do I diagnose a muscle imbalance between glutes, quads, hamstrings? 

Then once I've diagnosed that, Ill just start doing the proper exercises. So I just need help with figuring out that muscle imbalance.

I know this kinda sounds like asking for medical advice, but as I said before I can't get a PT or doc at the moment.

ultrarunning,1623938423,"Poles yes or no So I used poles on my first 100 miles finish. Never been a fan of them but with 6000+ meters of elevation I figured I had to. In the end I really think they made the difference and saved my legs a whole lot.

Now I want to try another 100 miles in a couple of months with a little less elevation (4500m) and I want to do it without poles.

I mean I like poles during climbing. Not only physically but especially mentally. When you have yet another climb and your legs are already very tired it's great that you have some support from your poles. Without poles I don't look forward to climbing, with poles I really don't mind.

However, I do like the 'free running' experience without poles. Have your hands free, especially during descent or technical parts my poles tend to get in my way. Plus the terrain here goes from climb to descent all the time so I really don't have time to constantly retract my poles, put them away and then 5 minutes later I need them again. Also I think poles make you slower overall.

ultrarunning,1623900752,"Looking for help to understand what went wrong during first 50k Hey y'all,

This is my first post here and I'm hoping to get some feedback on understanding why my first 50k didn't go as well as I was hoping. I would really appreciate any and all honest feedback!

I ran the War Hammer 50k in central Kentucky on June 12 last week. The course track was a roughly 27k out-and-back for a total of 54k or 33.6 miles and about 4,200 feet of gain and loss. The high temperature for the day was about 86 degrees with 80% humidity for a heat index of about 99 F.

The first 15 miles or so I felt great, and everything was going to plan - I was taking a GU Roctane gel every 30-45 minutes and trying to drink 32 oz water between each aid station (aid stations were at 6 miles and 12 miles). At about 15 miles, I started feeling my calves and groins wanting to cramp - I thought this may have been due to low electrolytes, so I took 2 GU Roctane electrolyte pills and continued. I hit the turn-around in second place after 2 hours and 45 minutes, feeling great in terms of my energy and cardiovascular system, but a bit nervous about the crampy sensations. Actual full-on cramps starting occuring at about mile 19 in my groins and calves, and the heat and humidity became really intense at the same time. This slowed me down significantly, but I came into the aid station at mile 21 in second place with a 10-15 minute lead on third still feeling so-so - like I definitely needed to slow down and get fluids in, but that I would continue running strong after a short break at the station.

This is where things started to go wrong. I took 2 GU pills, 2 shots of pickle juice and drank a small cup of Coke - the latter two I never tried during my training. After about ten minutes at the station, I started walking back on the track, but after about a mile, I got extremely nauseous - stomach hurting so badly that I had to sit down for about 20 minutes, until finally, I puked up every bit of the fluids and calories I put in my stomach at the aid station. It didn't seem like my body absorbed anything from my gut in this window, but I felt significantly better after puking, so I continued on walking the 6 miles to the final aid station. The 32 oz of fluids I had with me was not enough for this distance after purging all the fluids from the last aid station however, and when I tried to get GU's in, these also made me extremely nauseous. The nausea was so painful to the point that my new goal was to simply finish and to not DNF.

Basically no running happened in these 6 miles to the next aid station. Here, a similar situation played out - tried to carefully get some fluids and sugar in, felt extremely nauseous, puked everything up after 15 or 20 minutes. After this, I was actually able to eat a couple bowls of potato chips and drink some water and felt good enough that I set out for the last 6 miles. However, after about a mile, same situation - severe nausea, and symptoms of dehydration or heat exhaustion due to my inability to take in fluids. After a VERY slow 3 or so miles, I puked up everything left in my stomach, and felt marginally better such that I could walk the rest of the way in and finish the race in 9.5 hours.

In my training, I regularly used GU Roctane gels, and never had a hint of nausea from them, and had a multitude of runs in high humidity, but not in the combination of heat and humidity that we were in during this race. I also did not get quite the training I wanted to, due to unexpected life things that came up and multiple injuries that I didn't resolve until about 4 weeks before the race. All my training was on technical, rocky trails with my longest run being 17 miles and 2,000 feet of gain, with 13-15 11-12 mile runs with 800-1500 feet of gain.

If you read this whole thing, thanks! I really appreciate it. Overall, I think the nausea is what destroyed me. Because of the nausea, I was not able to get fluids or calories to absorb from my stomach after about mile 22. What I really want to know is how to learn from this and prevent it, as well as the muscle cramping, from happening in the future. Respiratory and energy-wise I felt great until my stomach started rejecting everything I put in it. Based on the details, do you all have any advice on what I did wrong and how to prevent nausea and cramps in the future? Also, is it possible despite the hot and humid conditions that I could have over-compensated and consumed too much salt? I was thinking this is what could have upset my stomach in the first place, between the salt pills and pickle juice.

TLDR: Ran first 50k, all was going well until about 22 miles in where cramps and major nausea set in. Struggled to walk the last 11 miles of the race due to dehydration and what I suspect was heat exhaustion, because I couldn't keep any food or fluids down whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday, after an abnormally busy Spring, I got a little over-excited on my first big day out in the mountains for the season. I had been running a decent amount (60 mpw) but mostly on roads. 35 mountain miles and 18,000 ft of climbing later, I landed myself in the hospital with a case of Rhabdo. I was only in for about 24 hours of IV fluids, and am out now, feeling mostly normal, just a little tired, legs are a little sore, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the proper place to ask questions about this is with my doctor, but doctors tend to be more concerned with things like kidney function than running performance. So my question is this: from a running perspective, what should I expect the recovery to be like? Is it just a matter of waiting until running feels okay and then easing into it based on feel? Or do I need to be super-duper-extra-careful? Or should I expect that all my muscles tissue is dead and returning to running is going to be a slow and discouraging process? I haven't really been able to find a concrete answer to what exactly will happen to my muscles after the enzyme levels return to normal.

On a related note: After the Rhabdo symptoms go away, do I still benefit from the rather large training stimulus? Or do I miss out on any strengthening because I crossed a certain threshold of destroying my muscles?

I drank a lot of water (two glasses with nuun tablets) before the race. Is overhydrating a thing? I sweated more in the first 10 miles than I think I‚Äôve ever sweat before. The weather was cool and cloudy and not a factor.

I don‚Äôt normally take in a ton of electrolytes during running, because I‚Äôve just never felt cramping. Usually cramps are a day later in the form of tight/soreness.

ultrarunning,1623499094,"Not-race report: Cold River Loop FKT (Adirondacks, NY) **Background**

I was a D1 walk-on college runner wayyyy back in 2006, but never really ran seriously in the decade or so prior to COVID shutdowns recently aside from random sign-ups for 10K's here and there that never really means sustained mileage or training. When my preschool (teaching job), gym, and other hobbies all got wiped away in March 2020, though, I figured... why not?

I had some solid enough residual speed from general fitness -- got a 21:XX 5K TT a few months in as well as a 1:53 HM. Aside from some trial-and-error to figure out how the hell to run through the freezing cold and pitch black darkness that defined our Syracuse winter, I kept logging miles and improving at various distance TTs as I rolled into 2021; by April of this year I had an 18:XX 5K, 1:25 HM, and was consistently running 70 miles a week.

Then the ultra bug bit me. I saw a local trail 50K with open spots for the middle of the month, not even two weeks out -- hey, why the hell not. I ran [3:59 in the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mtb87r/first_50k_ultra_35930_with_an_asterisk/), but made an early navigation flub and got DQ'd from the results. Still, tons of fun and super happy with the result. The next closest not-waitlisted ultra I could find was over in Long Island in May -- that one turned into a [slower 4:45 over some rough roots and stair stretches but much more successful result at first overall](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/n8ecbh/greenbelt_50k_on_long_island_1st_overall/), earning me free Salomon trail shoes and a chunky plaque. 

As June approached, no nearby races really fit with my schedule, so I turned to the trail descriptions of FKT. I bought a Salomon chest pack and tried it out on an [unsupported marathon-ish length run in the Winona State forest](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/winona-state-forest-ny), with some navigation and new pack hiccups slowing me down a bit from a quicker goal but still doing enough to earn the FKT by just under 15 minutes.

**NY/NE mountains**

I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I was never really a trail *runner*, but I'd done plenty of day hikes, a little backpacking, paved and gravel biking over big mountains, some winter skiing... lots of time up in Mt. Hood and the Cascades. Mountains? Cool, I like mountains.

Then I got to Syracuse. Shortly after moving in, wife and I planned a 3-day trip to NH's White Mountains, one of the seemingly more recommended options in our greater area. And it suuuuuuuuuuucked. Waist high (or worse) rock scrambling defined basically every single substantial climb. When you weren't doing that you were very often walking down a literal creek bed, either dry and made up entirely of basketball-sized rocks, or still full of running water. Gross.

We try a couple Adirondack options, slightly closer to us, and find basically the same thing. Well, shit. I guess we're city people now, with occasional dalliances to small, non-mountainous parks and forests.

**The Cold River Loop**

The breaking point that had both of us saying, *lol fuck no*, to coming back to the Adirondacks actually happened on some of the same trails that made up my FKT attempt last June. I'm pretty sure I thought and said I was never coming back... but... that was before I found out I could have my name published on the internet! Fame, fortune! My wife rolls her eyes when I tell her where and what I'm gonna be doing for my next big run.

Also, the loop skips the mountains themselves -- from what I'm readying it's 29 miles with ballpark 2,500 feet of elevation, divided into three manageable climbs and some smaller rollers. So I won't have rock scrambling... just plenty of little and medium ones. The current fastest time is 5:36, just about 11:30/mile pace -- I figure I can knock an hour or so off that, right? Right?

It's hot as fuck and disgustingly humid in Syracuse the week before my trip up there, but forecast for the trailhead area looks much nicer. I figure out how to mount a 1.5L bladded in my small Salomon pack (on the last FKT I'd used a 1L flask in the back and it sucked to swap/refill mid-run), pick up my usual snacks, buy some 100% DEET spray, and take a vacation day off of teaching to wake up at 5:15 and start my drive up north.

**lol, pace**

The first mile of the day is +290 feet elevation or so -- just about the toughest of the day, but relatively smooth surfaces and fair stuff. I come through in 9:44 and think, OK cool, nice and easy and I can drop down to my long run pace (8:00-8:30) on some of the easier miles. My pack with 2.5L of total fluids and some miscellaneous crap is heavy but fitting comfortably. There's some little rocks, roots, and stream crossings breaking up my flow but I get to \~10K at about 9:30 pace, right around what I'd need to do to beat the current time by a full hour.

Then there's the first big swamp. I tip-toe across branches that other visitors have draped across the muck, losing a minute or two, and then get a sustained climb as a reward afterwards. Next mile split comes in 11:50, hmph. And the trail is starting to get increasingly overgrown -- I'm catching spiderwebs in the face and all sorts of bush and tree branches to the shins and forearms. Hmph.

**Bushwhacking**

And the overgrowth only gets worse when I diverged from the ""main"" mountain ascent route. I keep hoping that the various plants I'm running through are only growing *into* the trail so I can successfully plow through them, which thankfully turns out to be true. But it's still rooted and rocky under the thick brush cover, only now I can't reliably see it -- so on a mostly downhill stretch from mile 12 through 16 I start splitting 12's and 13's, with more power-walking than true running.

I'm staying upright at least, with this cautious approach. Did I mention I'm miles away from cell coverage and I have no idea if anyone else is going to cross through this trail today (or tomorrow, or the next day)? Safety absolutely takes priority over pace. One benefit (well, the only benefit) is that I'm still feeling very fresh -- when the trail does start to clear up a bit, I easily shift back into low 9:00 pace for miles 17 and 18.

**Thou shalt not hurdle at mile 25**

I get to the 2/3rds-point feeling solid enough, but a little bit hungry. My legs and stomach are mad at each other and I'm struggling to eat/drink while running, so I start to run the flat/smooth bits than fuel while walking the overgrown and rock-covered bits. The trail is certainly better now than it was an hour ago, but don't worry -- still plenty of un-runnable stretches to give me time to take in some sustenance.

I start to think about FKT pace for the first time in a while as I get down to 8, 7, 6 miles to go. My run-walk mix is still rattling off miles faster than the average pace of the current leader. I think about a couple of round-number milestones and what I need to do to bring my average pace to under 10:00 for the day (finish the last 10K in 8:55 pace, not happening unless it's somehow on a high school track). OK, sub-5 hours? Maybe with some low 9:XX miles -- the trail is looking better and better now, but I haven't seen another human being in two-plus hours at this point. There's downed trees or large branches every 100 or 200 meters; I try to jump over a very small one and nearly wipe out, and rethink that idea. Carefully stepping over them? Sounds good. No sub-5, though.

**The end**

I get a little morale boost from seeing a hiker with 5K to go, then two more. The last \~1.2 miles is stuff I'd seen at the very start of the day, and I laugh at morning-me thinking that this stretch of trail was the ""bad"" part of the day I should be running conservatively. I register a 5:04:40 and see my glorious Subaru with dry clothes, fresh water, and an internal combustion engine that will (hours later) get me back to a shower and couch. I get pizza slices *and* McDonald's in Tupper Lake, then have an uncomfortable 3.5-hours on my butt in the driver's seat before arriving back home.

In two weeks I've got my last day of preschool teaching for the year, followed by a [last man standing-style ultra](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=79693) local in Syracuse. A week after that we're renting a truck, filling it with all our shit, and moving back to Oregon -- so this jolly FKT adventure was my Adirondack send-off, a nice little *so long and thanks for all the rocks*.

### Background
So I started running about 8 years ago, doing a mile on the treadmill a couple of times a week, trying to lose weight. I slowly picked up running more often and further distances, but never anything further than a half marathon.

In 2018 I became interested in alpinism/mountaineering, learned a lot more about training theory and started keep better track of my fitness.

In 2019, I ran my first marathon the Reykjavik Marathon, I followed the [BAA level 3 training program](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/levelthree), mixed in with some of the lessons I learned from mountaineering training. Finishing that marathon was an incredible experience for me, it was such a monumental task, the weeks of following a training plan had added up to something incredible.

I had always been interested in ultras, and knew it was something I wanted and needed in my life. I had a few races I wanted to attempt in 2020, but Covid shut that down. Also, at the time I was located in Boston, and did not have a car, so getting vertical was always a bit tougher on the few trail runs I got out to.

Fast forward to 2021, I moved to the PNW.

### Training
I have read enough research papers, published studies, articles, reddit posts, and books (Training for the Uphill Athlete &amp; Running your First Ultramarathon) that I thought I generally had a good grasp of how to set up my own training plan, especially one that meshes with the flux of my life and can adapt with me.

The second half of 2020 was really bad for my running, but 2021 started strong. I got back into the joy of running, and by mid February I knew I was ready to start training for something bigger. I found a 50K (Ridge Route Ultra) which got moved to June 5th, which would give me ~12 weeks to ramp up training and mileage. I picked up the weekly mileage. From about mid march, I picked it up to 30-40mpw. I would aim to get 3-4 aerobic runs during the week, anywhere between 4-8 miles depending on the day. The weekends were either a trail run, or a long road run. 

April is when things started feeling more serious, I received my 2nd Covid vaccine dose at the beginning of the month and it put me off of running for a couple of days, but I eased back in to it. By mid April I was feeling good, but a bit scared by the distance, I knew I was capable, but I needed to break the mental barrier, on April 25th, I committed to running a road marathon training run (ended up with 26.7mi). I felt pretty good after, I took the few days after to do some easy active recovery runs, never letting my hart rate or pace sneak up, I felt solid. 

Now its May, 1 month to the race, two weeks after my training marathon I knew I needed to get on the idea of back to back long runs, so I did 19 road miles on Saturday, and 11 road miles on Sunday, those sucked quite a bit, but it felt nice to hit 30 miles, and know what tired legs were. I had a training friend who was running a trail marathon (and her first marathon) and she was a bit scared by the distance, so the following weekend, we went out and broke that barrier for her, we ran a trail marathon, making sure to keep it easy. The elevation gain, the heat, and the fact that I had not slept 2 nights prior made it a tough run. 

At this point I get an email from my original ultra, stating they were postponing the race to ""sometime in July."" I was too committed to June 5th, and to a 50k, so I began searching, but decided to run the Trail Marathon with my training partner. But needed something to scare me a bit, something a bit tougher, so I made the personal decision to add on some ""bonus miles"" to the race.

The following week, I added in some intervals and some stair climbing on back to back days, this hit my legs hard, but by the weekend I was back to feeling fresh. I was blown away by generally how well I was recovering, so I went out for another road marathon training run. This one took me through a slightly darker mental place, it felt harder mentally, but still doable. This run really helped make the marathon distance less scary, I know I can do it I just need to push the vertical, this was also the last big week before the taper began.

I dropped my mileage a very slightly for week 1 of a 2 week taper, introducing some hill repeats as my last ""hard"" running effort.

Week 2 of taper, or race week, I climbed Mt St Helens on Tuesday, felt tired on Wednesday, and didnt manage my time wisely on Thursday or Friday, so no more runs were had, Race Day was here.


### Pre-race
Race morning I woke up 2 hours before the race, grabbed a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee from McDonald's (the sandwich might have been a mistake). My girlfriend dropped off my training partner and I at the starting area, we grabbed out shirts and bibs, and hung out in the warm car. I look around, wondering if I overpacked my vest, I brought 1500 calories worth of snacks, 2 liters of water, my trusty Norvan SL, an emergency bivy, and my garmin in reach. The last two items might seem like overkill, but after the incident in China, I felt a few extra grams were more than worth it.

### Race
The race only had 40 participants for the marathon, I figured it would be a bit thin during the race. We get counted down, a few people fly off the line, we are starting up hill, into some snow patches; its cold, windy, and I haven't decided if that breakfast sandwich is going to come out of either end in a mile. 

Normally it takes me 1-3 miles to ""settle in"" to let my breathing, my heart rate, and my legs figure out that we are in this for a while. The first 3 miles gained about 500 feet vertical, not awful by any means, but all of the factors added up to making me wonder if this was a mistake. Mile 3-11 were all generally downhill, but the sandwich sat in my stomach, a constant reminder of a potential mistake. My training partner and I had communicated well in advance that we weren't going to actively run together, if one of us felt better, we had no qualms splitting off. But our paces matched, at mile 7 we talked about how we hadn't ""settled in"" yet and how it was a bit strange. But suddenly things sort of clicked, we picked up 2-3 other friends and made a solid middle pack. 

Mile 12 had a couple of aggressively sharp elevation spikes, this is when I remembered ""trail running is sometimes hiking, and sometimes walking."" Mile 13-16 had us lose over 700 feet, blasting down those hills felt incredible, the high cadence running downhill felt great.

Mile 18 had an aid station where I topped off with about 1 liter of tailwind because I knew the next 9 miles were going to be hot, and a non stop climb.

Our pack of runners all quickly ran out of words and just settled in for the continuous uphill climb, which finally broke with about a quarter mile to spare on the race, all we had left was a nice wide downhill to the finish. We all broke out into a run, and then a sprint to the finish line, crossing it felt amazing. Completing the race, getting back to in person events, cheering on other runners, I missed that. 

But my run wasn't over...

### ""Post""-race
My girlfriend was waiting for me in the parking lot, she was dressed for a run. She offered to put my vest in her car, but I felt that was against the spirit of the unnecessarily contrived goal I was going for. We started running laps around the parking lot, laps that were ~.2 mi. I made a point of not trying to look at pace, distance, or keep track of how many laps we were doing. I looked down at my watch, when I crossed the 30 mile mark, did another lap and that's when I figured out each lap was ~.2mi. those last 5 laps felt so long. I was mentally ready to stop. Finally we approached the car again, I had 31.25 on the watch, broke the 50K and stopped moving for the first time in quite a while. 

It was an incredible journey to get there, I loved everyone and everything it took to get there. Now on to another goal, maybe equally as contrived. A lot of people helped me get to where I was going, but huge thanks to /u/TylerCAndrews you are an incredible athlete and have definitely inspired me to keep pushing harder with running and in the mountains.

This passed weekend I put in 33.1 miles. 10 miler trail run Friday, half marathon road run Saturday night at 1130PM and 10 mile road run Monday. (I had to run on the road because of circumstances that happened in life) Monday about 5 miles in i think i got shin splints in my right shin, I finished my run but it hurt. This is my first time getting shin splints, so I am not to worried about it. I think my road running shoes might need to be swapped out, also I'm not used used to road running. that's what might have caused the issue.

I skipped yesterdays run and ran 4 miles this morning in my trail running shoes with no pain (these shoes have way less miles on them). I have a 6 mile run due Friday, and 20 miler Saturday.

Background: I'm a fairly seasoned 50k+ runner. I have done somewhere between 6-10 50ks, and a couple of supported FKTs around 45 miles in distance. I am competitive at these events, I've placed in the top 3 for my gender at several 50ks and successfully claimed FKTs.

This year I decided to train for a 100 miler and I have been following a training plan pretty religiously since November for that. I've missed maybe 3 runs from the entire training plan since then. I have completed many 75+ mile weeks, long runs over 30 miles, back-to-back long runs etc. The 100k this weekend was my qualifying race.

I knew it would be tough since 100k is the furthest distance I have ever run, but words can't even tell you how crummy I still feel (it's Monday morning now, the race was Saturday). I still pretty much can't walk. My feet are still massively swollen and a couple of major muscle groups in my legs just basically don't work at all. I think I'm going to have to call in sick from work because of how much I'm hobbling. I simultaneously can't do anything but nap/sleep while also getting terrible quality naps/sleep because my heart rate and body temperature are still so elevated (per my health tracking device) and my legs are twitching and throbbing.

Is it normal for your body to just go through the ringer more than ever before once you kind of go beyond that 50 mile mark? Any tips for me other than the obvious stuff? I know it will be a while before I can do anything other than super easy short runs. But I'm trying to survive to the point where even going for a walk sounds possible.

ultrarunning,1623058207,"Walking vs Running (Beginner Query) Hi all, first some background: I have my first ultra in a couple of weeks at the UK Race to the King. It‚Äôs 53 miles over hilly terrain with approx. 5,000 feet of altitude gain. I have been training c. 50 miles per week for a few months and lately have shifted my training away from flat running more towards trails and hills, so I think I should be more or less good to go. I‚Äôm shooting for around 9-10 hours, but that is probably too ambitious. My ‚ÄúB‚Äù goal is under 12 hours and my ‚ÄúC‚Äù goal is avoiding a DNF - quite a wide range given the unknowns involved in a first ultra!

For reference, I have a 1:27 HM PB but haven‚Äôt run a competitive marathon before - I started running last year to cope with lockdowns like many others I‚Äôm sure! My longest training run (or any run) so far is 22 miles, but I am planning to do 30 miles today as my final long run before tapering for the race.

As the race as drawn nearer, I have been researching ultra running a bit more and noticed that a lot of resources recommend walking uphill sections to save your legs/lungs. In my training I have tried to avoid this other than for scheduled walking/eating ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù or if my heart rate has really spiked. 

My questions are: if I am shooting for the best time that I am capable of (whatever than may be), should I be walking the hills to save my legs? Should I walk the initial hills to save my legs for later? Or am I ok sticking to the approach I have been using in training (walk only when needed for food/drink or to settle a heart rate spike)?

**Where Can I Hire a Hacker to Change Grades?** 

So which brings us to the main question ‚Äî Can you hire a hacker to change your grades? Yes, it is possible to hire a hacker to change your university grades and college grades. It has been done time and time again. It mainly depends on the kind of security behind your school‚Äôs system.

I had a personal experience when I was in college, I accidentally ‚Äúhacked‚Äù my grade book system. On my grade book, if you clicked a teacher‚Äôs name, it would show you basic demographic information about that teacher, which was all supposed to be public. This included their work email address, to which student emails were supposed to be directed, so I frequently used it to verify that I was sending emails to the correct address.

One day, I was trying to email a teacher, and wanted to verify that I had the right email address. I opened my grade book, and logged in using the password that my browser had remembered, but it occurred to me that I had completely forgotten what that password actually was.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your University Grades**

So, I went to this teacher demographic page, and verified the email address. Afterwards, I decided to go to my own profile page to see if I could find or change my password. When I went to my profile, I noticed that, instead of my name, it said the name of the teacher whose demographic page I had just checked. And near the bottom of the page, it had a password box with the teacher‚Äôs password.

From a computer security perspective, like almost every website where you log in and out, I would assume this website had a variable which stored the name of the logged-in user. However, this was the same variable as the one that stored the name of the teacher when you went to look at demographic information.

Then, when you go to your profile, it just accesses the information of whoever is stored in the ‚Äúuser‚Äù variable, without using any encoded session ID or token or anything to verify that the value of the ‚Äúuser‚Äù variable was actually the user who had logged in. To this day, I cannot believe how awful that security was. At that age, I didn‚Äôt know any of that and had never looked at computer code before, otherwise I would have experimented to find the flaw.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades on College / University Transcript**

A few days later, the teacher went over to me to brag that he had fixed it (I think he was under the impression that I had intentionally found the exploit as a white-hack or something). The layout was changed and the teacher demographic page was removed. The next year, we switched to a completely new grade book system.

I‚Äôve never heard of any grade book with such poor security standards, but there have been cases where students have hacked grade books and changed grades. These include placing a key logger on campus computers, phishing the teachers, befriending teachers and getting passwords, finding passwords on unattended computers, etc.

But, possible, legal, and moral are three different things. Is it possible for you to hack a grade book and change your grades? Probably. Is it legal? No, and it‚Äôs very rare to be able to pull that off without getting caught. If you change only your grades, if anyone ever happens to notice, you‚Äôre caught immediately. If you change a bunch of grades, the discrepancy becomes obvious, and the changes will likely be reverted.

**Best Solution to Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades**

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in college, applying to an elite graduate school, so you change your grades to ensure your GPA is high enough, and you get in. That means you have automatically become qualified and actually earned admission. If you are not really left with much options, this might seem the smartest thing to do. What are you waiting for?

Lots of pain increasing when I try to run. I tried PT and a special patella brace, but nothing stops the pain from returning. Next week I am getting the tendon needled to facilitate faster localized healing, after which I will not be able to do anything with the leg for a week. I'll have to build up strength walking after that.

Six and a half weeks ago I ran a 6hrs15min PB 50k, and four and a half weeks ago I ran a 5hr55min PB 50k (I'm solidly mid pack) - both with similar elevation changes and on similar courses to the forthcoming double marathon. I recover fast and doing two 50ks in two weeks was fine. So I'm not being stupid in doing the double marathon. However, I usually average about 30miles a week, but that can vary from like 20miles to 45miles. Since the last 50k I've only averaged about 22miles a week, in total, with my longest run being 10miles. Which is obviously not ideal. Have got a few long hikes in in that time though.

What I am wondering is what it's worth me doing in the next two weeks? It's gone warm and sunny here (UK) and I suspect that it will be like that for the race, so I feel I should try and acclimatise a bit. But obviously at the stage I'm not going to be able to do much useful training. Is it worth a last long run? Or just keep things ticking over?

I've completed two road marathons in the past (2018/2019) in the 3:45 range. For the last 12 months I've averaged about 45 miles/week. The last several months it's been closer to 55 miles/week. I'm 49 and female.

I was training for a half marathon using Hanson's advanced. I didn't have a specific one in mind, just using the schedule. About two months ago I decided that I should train for a 50k trail race instead. I've been running the roads during the week and a long threshold run once a week.

ultrarunning,1622449092,"Finished first 100 miles race! So last weekend I've finished my first 100-mile race and I've finished quite allright. I never thought about giving up once so my experience could maybe help other people. The race was Grand Trail des Lacs et Chateaux in the Belgium Ardennes, 165km and around 7000D+ which is pretty serious for this country since it's mostly flat ([https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/](https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/)).

It took me around 31 hours to finish. I took longer then I wanted because my friend got injured at the 120k mark and they needed to evacuate him. He blew up his achilles and couldn't even walk. This was his own fault though, he trained like \~50K a month for the last 3 months so I was surprised he even made it to 120K. I wasn't going to quit because of him though and once he was safe I continued my journey alone in the middle of the night deep inside the creepy forrest where a lot of eyes were watching me :) 

I'm pretty sure this was the thoughest thing I've ever done. I mean I did Marathon des Sables in 2018 but that was relativley easy compared to this. This was so damn technical, some parts I could only go like 2-3 km/h plus staying awake for 31 hours while navigating along side dangerous cliffs and waterfalls is already a challenge on it's own.

Nutricion is def. the most important thing during a race like this. My body was just screaming for food the entire time. I had cliff bars as fuel and sometimes I took around 3 in 1 hour! Insane.... I'm so sick of them right now I can probably never eat them again.

The second most important thing is water and salt. I was drinking a lot and I also had sodium tablets which contained salt and magnesium that I took like every 20K. I was also eating salted foods at the checkpoints (mostly chips and chicken soup) and had around 15 bananas total. I am a salty sweater though, I knew this from MDS where I took a salt tablet every 30 min. My entire backpack was white of my sweat.

I did pee every once in a while and looked at the color. If it became dark yellow I took more salt and drank more water until it was light yellow again. I managed this really well and felt great the entire race. I also had a lot of coca cola at the checkpoints for my cafeine needs :)

Right now my body is totally exhausted but I do feel great. I still can't believe I've finished a 100-mile race, I never thought I could do this. It just seemed impossible but a decent amount of training, preperation and good management of nutricion and I have my 6 ITRA points :)",0.06,0.805,0.135,0.9867,2564,467,68,29
ultrarunning,1622417204,"Race Report: Bryce Canyon 50k (my first ultra!) **Pre-race**
This may have been the hardest thing I have EVER done. Starting on Thursday, I increased my carb intake a lot, hydrated like mad, and rolled out my legs as much as possible.

The morning of the race started out well. I was up early, ate my normal oatmeal, protein powder, and banana, and hydrated with water + nuuns and coffee. I was at the start with plenty of time to get ready and man, I was nervous, but I was also really excited.

**Start to Proctor Canyon (miles 0-3)**
The run to the first aid station was fine. It was still cool and while sandy, not difficult. I drank a bit of water, ate about 100 calories, and was still in a great mood! I did not stop at this aid station. 

**Proctor Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 3-8)**
The next trek to the second aid station was technically tricky but again, not too hard. There was a LOT of uphill on ridges and a ton of people, so this was slow. I was still feeling great! The weather was low 60s, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and taking in liquid hydration (~400cal total). By this point I had probably consumer about 1.5L of water. At this aid station I refilled my pack with water and grabbed some watermelon and grapes and just kept going. 

**Hillsdale Canyon to Red Canyon (miles 8-14)**
This was great! I felt strong and was able to keep a good pace. There were rolling hills and some ridges but nothing too technical. Again, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and liquid hydration (~400cal total). I also ate a banana since it was not hot yet and I figured I could keep it down. During this section I started using my salt tabs to prepare for the heat that was coming. I likely drank 1.5L during this section. At this aid station, I again filled up with water, got more tailwind, grabbed some applesauce and more watermelon, and kept moving. I was still in a GREAT mood, plodding along, happily running through the hoodoos. Little did I know the misery that was ahead. 

**Red Canyon back to Red Canyon (miles 14-19)**
This was the loop from hell! At this point the temperature spiked above 85F and the climb was completely exposed. It felt like it was a constant uphill along ridges, somewhat technical and VERY SLOOOOOOW. It was absolutely gorgeous, but this nearly broke me. After this I was seriously considering dropping. Making friends is what got me through this section. It was SO hard, but we were all in it together. It is amazing what having others to commiserate with can do for your state of mind. Once we were out of this loop and back on the flats, I had to walk more than I wanted. My body was just spent. Big reason, I didn‚Äôt consume enough calories. I just couldn‚Äôt deal with eating while trudging through this which was a major mistake. I likely only took in 200cal during this loop, but I think I drank 1.5L. I did take in a gel with electrolytes and caffeine. 

Back to the aid station, I grabbed a lot more water, more fuel from my drop bag, more tailwind, and went to the bathroom. I drabbed more watermelon, applesauce, and just kind of chilled for a couple minutes. This is where things started to hurt. It was HOT. I think we were going above 90 at this point and it was dragging me down. Before heading back onto the trail, I soaked my buff in cold water and poured it on my head and then wrapped the cold buff around my neck.

**Red Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 19-25)**
With the heat and the altitude, I was starting to not feel great. For the remainder of the race the temperature was above 90F with a max of 95F. Out of the aid station I just walked a lot. I took a salt pill and some water and started to feel a bit better. I was moving along though, running on the flats and downhills, and made another friend. At mile 26 though I fell and that cost me time. Other than a bruise on my left shoulder and scraping my left knee, I was fine but the swelling in the knee started to slow my pace. 

And then came another massive climb. This was unreal. We were grouping up again and EVERYONE was struggling. It was like this came out of nowhere, the heat was absolutely the contributing factor at this point. I also had my slowest mile EVER here. My left knee started to hurt, and I had to sit a couple times. I also ran into another runner who was seriously dehydrated so I stayed with her for a while, gave her a salt pill and some water, and made sure she was ok (she ended up DNFing at the aid station). The heat was seriously no joke. During this section I drank 1.5L of water, ate only 300 calories (again, major mistake but I could not take in more), and had a salt pill. 

At this aid station I refilled water (but not my hydration back, whoops!), but I don‚Äôt think I grabbed any fuel. Nothing looked good. I did think about dropping again but realized I was just being ridiculous and pushed on! 


**Hillsdale Canyon to Proctor Canyon (miles 25-30)**
We had one last climb and again, wtf. It was awful. Around mile 28, my right foot was bugging me. I was assuming I was getting a blister on the bottom and my toes were sore. This made it really hard to run so I shuffled along and basically gave up on finishing in less than 9 hours. This part was pretty uneventful. I ate another 300 calories, drank ALL the water I had on me (1L), and was so happy when the elevation was over. The run into this last aid station was magical. When I got there, it turned out there were out of water, so I grabbed some gnarly (do not recommend) and some pickles. 

**Proctor Canyon to Finish (miles 30-33.8)**
These final miles were all downhill, thank god. It was SO HOT! I ran a bit but again, shuffled along. My right foot was really bugging me but I was so excited to nearly be done. With less than 2 miles left, I started to cry. I was SO overwhelmed. I never thought I would be able to do something like this. When I saw the finish line and could hear the music, a rush of excitement came over me and I found the strength to run along the finish line. As they said my name, and announced this was my first 50k, I started to sob (all on video, lol). I was just so fucking overwhelmed by this experience. 

**THE END!**
I stopped at the medic to clean up my knees, ate a burger, Oreos, bananas, and chips, and drank a lot of water. Once I took off my shoes, I realized there was SAND in my shoe that had built up on the bottom of my right foot. This is what was causing the pain. There do not seem to be any blisters, but my toenails may not fare well. Right now they are ok, but my toes are sore. I am also pretty sure I have planter fasciitis in my right foot. But other than that, I FEEL AMAZING! I am not too sore, I can walk fairly well, and I am ready to do this again!!!!

Through this experience, I learned that I am capable of so much more than I would have ever imagined. Between the altitude (7000-8500ft), the heat (85-95F), and the elevation (5882 ft), this was hands down the hardest thing I have ever done but will absolutely carry me forward through future ultras. For a first ultra, I think I selected an incredibly challenging one. The race was overwhelming and emotional. I doubted my ability many times, several of the climbs made me consider dropping, the altitude kicked my butt, and the heat was intense. But I was determined to finish. Remembering my training, and the advice you have given me, I was able to work through the doubts and I found my rhythm. Because of my training, I learned how to handle the pain and challenges this trail threw at me.

Overview:
The race went better than I could have hoped! I started off feeling incredible and kept my pace steady for the first 8-9 miles. I wasn‚Äôt going in expecting or planning to place, but when someone told me I was in third at mile 16...I had to hold it. I‚Äôm really thrilled about placing, especially since I‚Äôve never run a race over 10 miles before and only really started running 7 months ago.

Pre-Race:
Friday night, my girlfriend, Ally, and I mapped out the aid-stations and put together food/hydration packets for hand-offs. The schedule we set up was as follows:

3 bags of roughly 200 calories of dried fruit to be handed to me at the 1/3 and 2/3 aid stations. (Same one since it was an out and back) I ate food every twenty minutes. 

Five Gu to be taken every hour. 

4 nuun tabs for the first 9 miles (though I opted instead to stick with nuun until mile 22. 

1 liter of tailwind for mile 9 onwards (switched to mile 22 as noted above)

I carried a 17oz handheld, which I topped off at every aid station.

On race day, I had a granola bar and a banana at 4:30am. I drank a redbull at 5:30.

I chose to wear a lightweight long sleeved shirt going out, as the temp was in the high 30s. At mile 9 I changed into an ultra light short sleeved shirt. This turned out to be the pro move. The weather wound up getting hotter than forecasted.

The race!

Miles 1-6 - Start to the Tunnel Aid Station

The first leg of the race went great. I was feeling a bit of soreness in my left calf, but that resolved itself after mile four.

Rather than rushing out, I tried to keep mid-pack to conserve energy. I settled into an 8:30 pace with a group of 4 other runners. We all ran together until mile 7.

Mile 4 was the road section with an unexpected 200 feet of climb. Going out this was easy...coming back not so much. 

Miles 6-9 - Tunnel to Hollywood AS

I split from the group at mile 7 and kept a comfortable pace ahead. This stretch was relatively uneventful. I made a point to eat as much of the first bag of dried fruit as I could. I made it through most of it.

Miles 9-15.5 - Hollywood to Tin Can AS

The handoff and shirt change at Hollywood went suuuuper smoothly. I was in and out in 30 seconds. Huge thanks to Ally for being super on top of crewing.

After Hollywood I let my pace get away from me a little. Logged a few 7:40-7:50 miles, which I knew would come back to bite me later. I started passing runners from the tail end of the 50 mile here.

I was still feeling great at the tail end of the this leg. Near Tin Can I passed the fourth place runner, but I wouldn‚Äôt find that out until mile 16.

Miles 15.5 - 22

At mile 16-17 (after the turn around) I ran into the group I started with, who let me know I was in 3rd place. Wasn‚Äôt expecting this, but for sure wasn‚Äôt going to let myself lose it.

Mile 19 was where I started paying for the faster miles early on. Nothing bad, but felt the fatigue and started to dial things back a little...likely not enough though. Knowing I was holding onto third...but not knowing by how much made me push harder.

I made it back to Hollywood feeling pretty good. Took about a minute breather while Ally swapped my food, loaded up the tailwind, and I shook the rocks out of my shoes.

Miles 22-25

This is where things started to fall apart a little. I dialed back to roughly a 9 minute pace coming out of Hollywood. I‚Äôd taken a pretty big swig of water and downed some cranberry juice. Stomach wasn‚Äôt handling speed well. This leveled out a little, and I was able to get some running around my goal pace, but I was fading fast.

Around here I started to get a sharp pain on the top of my left foot. Not sure what caused it, but from mile 22 to the end, every step was agony.

I was really feeling it when I hit Tunnel AS. Wasn‚Äôt terrible though.

Miles 25-31 (Tunnel AS to Finish!)

This sucked. Like really sucked. Remember that surprise elevation? That sucked. I felt okay up until the marathon (3:39!) but after that things started falling apart. The road stretch was awful and the uphills were aggravating my foot. This is when my quads decided that they were done too.

I would up hiking a few of the hills. The road stretch felt like it would never end. 

After the roads I was toast. Clocked mid to high 9s for the rest of the run. At mile 28, I met Ally along the trail and she paced me to the finish. This was a godsend cause I was pretty much ready to walk.

The last two miles were the hardest I‚Äôd run in my life. I was ready to just take a nap on the side of the trail. On the bright side though, my legs hurt so much that I barely noticed the pain in my foot.

I survived though. I held on to third place and ran it into the finish. I then walked about twenty feet before I gave up and laid down.

ultrarunning,1622138680,"Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim adventure report Three years ago I was just a casual runner, running about 20 miles per week. I loved trail running though and would come to learn about the trails in the Grand Canyon and wanted to run across them. I didn‚Äôt even know it was a thing people did, but I wanted to run them in one day since I don‚Äôt back backpack. I had never even run a marathon and didn‚Äôt even know what an ultra marathon was at the time. I spent about 9 months of dedicated training to run R3 in a day, but in the end it wasn‚Äôt enough. I made lots of mistakes. I pushed too hard, redlined it the whole time, didn‚Äôt control my heart rate going uphill, and didn‚Äôt have dry clothes or a jacket for the cold north rim. I made it across in one piece, but was absolutely not prepared for the return, so I took a shuttle back with my tail between my legs. 

The next year 2019 I ran my first marathon followed by three ultra marathons. In 2020 I ran over 2000 miles. With all that extra training and experience being on my legs for extended periods, I felt I was ready for another attempt. So I booked a race schedule around getting a nice buildup to culminate with another R3 attempt.

February - 6 hour trail race
March - 24 hour flat looped race (which I hoped would be my first 100 mile distance, and would be my only effort to match the expected time on feet of R3)
April - very hilly 50k
May - R3

The build up races were a disaster. The 6 hour trail race was cut short because I didn‚Äôt have spikes and the trail froze as we were running in the snow, leading to only 17 miles completed. The March race I hit a distance PR of 68 miles within the first 14 hours, but gave myself tendonitis from having my shoes tied too tight, leading to two weeks of zero running. And the 50k I went into very undertrained because of the preceding injury. All that also made my knee start giving me fits. I almost cancelled the whole thing, but my doctor gave me the green light saying I likely wouldn‚Äôt cause any permanent damage (just extended recovery). 

Here was my plan: power hike down all of South Kaibab, power hike across the mid canyon with short running bursts just to test my knee on the flat areas, and control my ascent up North Kaibab without burning out like last time. If that all went well, I would give it hell on the way back. If not, I gave myself permission to bail again due to injury. 

Starting down SK my knee was feeling good. It kind of got to 2-3 on the pain scale it had been doing before and just held there, never getting worse. Power hiking is about all I can do anyway, last time it took me 1:45 to get to the river, this time 2:05 just hiking, so not much time even lost with less damage to my legs. 

Across the mid canyon I also did well. I stuck to the plan and only ran for a few short bursts where I had a flat or slight downhill grade. The knee continued to hold up well. I did my first fluid refill at Cottonwood which is about 14 miles in. 

Once you go past Manzanita the climb becomes relentless. You climb for lengths and grades (and altitude) that we simply don‚Äôt have in the Midwest, so literally my only experience was of the prior failure in this very spot of the canyon three years prior. I think it helped at least a little to have a HRM this time which I didn‚Äôt have before. This let me find a good pace for the hr I was targeting, or at least didn‚Äôt want to exceed. Surprisingly, I still bested my slowest mile by 5m/m (45 vs 40) and summited the north rim in fantastic shape, one hour slower than prior. 

After changing socks and lubing up I was ready for the return. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind this time, I was going to finish this thing!! I checked in with my trail buddy Jay I had picked up a few miles back. We had been leap frogging for a while, only he bonked hard over the last 2 miles. He was going to come back, but needed more rest time, so I left him to catch back up later. 

1.7 miles back down I trail returned to Supai tunnel which I didn‚Äôt spend long at going up. This time I stopped for a proper rest (my first and only), lunch, and to refill my 2L bladder a second time. During my break Jay came strolling in as expected. We headed out a few minutes later and stayed together all the way back to Manzanita. Normally I really enjoy blasting the downhills. I really wanted to give them hell here and pick up some time, but I‚Äôm definitely not used to such loose gravely steep descents that give you little traction, and my knee just didn‚Äôt like grades that exceeded ~ -5% grade or so, so I had to power hike the majority of this as well.

Back at Manzanita, Jay really needed another proper stop. He had a hot spot to attend to and also needed to eat. We agreed to separate once more, with me fully expecting that he‚Äôd catch me again some number of miles later as he‚Äôd been doing for the last 10-12 miles. 

This part of the trail is where things finally start to level off a little. The average grade is typically -2-3% coming back down, which my knee was just fine with. Still, with 28+ miles on my legs, a full 15L pack, and having climbed to 8200 feet just 2 hours ago, I could only manage 15-16 minute miles, with a best mile of 13:25. But I didn‚Äôt care. I was doing this thing, and I was doing it strong. And I was still ahead of my suspected paces should I have to walk the whole thing. 

I lucked out so much with the weather. Many people who are more confident with their experience running hills and mountains might do this between November and April. The upshot it you get more moderate temps. The downside is the north rim is closed, so there‚Äôs no bail out option. You‚Äôre coming back to the south rim the way you came whether you like it or not. Anyway, the weather. I was expecting highs in the upper 80s or low 90s. A couple days earlier it had been those temps and higher. But Saturday 5/22 only got to about 80 degrees as the high at Phantom Ranch. Cruising back down to these lowest altitudes felt warm relative to the rest of the day, but it was still quite comfortable. 

I hit phantom ranch right before the dinner bell was to ring. It was about 4:30 or so and campers and lodgers were gathering for their coveted steak dinner. I refilled my water/Gatorade powder once more, tried to lube inconspicuously, put more food from my pack into my accessible pockets, and quickly headed off to finish my last 9.5 miles. 

The river trail runs alongside the Colorado for 1.7 miles before taking you to Bright Angel trail, the most famed and popular trail in the park. I‚Äôd always heard people decry the river trail, and now I know why. Every time you start gaining elevation you quickly lose it. The whole thing is sand; I managed over 35 miles without getting crap in my shoes and 50 paces in my shoe is filling with sand. And then there‚Äôs the rocks. Most of the corridor trails are well groomed, but I guess because this one doesn‚Äôt get foot traffic from the mules it doesn‚Äôt get pounded flat like the rest, so there‚Äôs lots of rock sticking up from the trail (it reminded me of the Ozark trail in Missouri). 

Once I hit Bright Angel, it was as beautiful as I could ever expect from being in the desert. Everything was lush green from spring growth. The climb wasn‚Äôt too bad. Everything was clicking. I wish I had more to report in this area, but the one thing of note wasn‚Äôt what was there, it‚Äôs what wasn‚Äôt there - Jay. I kept looking over my shoulder expecting him to come up on as he had done many other times, but he never did. The trail was also so desolate, quiet and peaceful for a good six miles or so. I went a few miles without seeing a soul - a rarity for a corridor trail in May. I guess all the rim to rimmers had finished and overnight campers were already down below. At 3 mile rest house though is when I started to run into people desperately trying to get out of the canyon before dark. I passed probably 20 people in the last 2 miles, including one getting emergency help from a ranger.

Once I got to the tunnels I knew I was finally close. The climb up BA isn‚Äôt as steep as NK, but it‚Äôs longer and it was lonelier not having anyone going my speed. And just like that, I popped out at Bright Angel Trailhead. Moving time 15:45, total time 16:45. Consumed about 4,400 calories of almost all carbs, including 8 liters of Gatorade from powder.

I found out the next day via Facebook that Jay‚Äôs foot gave him more grief and he finished an hour behind me. 

Next steps, I need to let my knee rest and heal. It‚Äôs really not that bad, but I want it back to 100%, where it was 2 months ago. https://imgur.com/a/RTZx9cZ/",0.078,0.831,0.091,0.9683,8624,1652,207,95

Curious what lube/tape.. etc you use for (1) blister prevention and (2) once you have blisters? 

Ive seen various recommendations in similar threads, but looking for a compilation here so I can do a bit more research. 

Sometimes even with the right socks and shoes, ya just get em! 

I will use chauff cream sometimes on longer runs in potential hot spots, but again this stuff is expensive. I prefer tape / pads on potential hots spots as prevention vs the chauff cream because my feet feel slippery in my shoes after.

Then blistex blister pads if/when they form. Another product I used to use is now discontinued.

ultrarunning,1621507946,"First steps- Mountain 40k in October- does my training plan look ok? Not an ultra, sorry if that is not allowed. Building up to ultras. Here in Spain 50k seems to be a less popular distance- the mountain running circuit seems mostly to have events in the 40ish, 60ish, 80ish then 100+ range.

**The race**: 42km approx. with 1800m+ vert, October 16, In El Escorial, NW of Madrid, Mostly on mountain trails, dirt roads.

**Me**: 45M, currently doing 50-60km/week usually, with long runs of up to 32k/20miles, almost all on trails/dirt roads. Mostly hilly runs with frequent mountain outings of 500m+ at weekends.

**Factors to consider**: The heat of summer- sometimes up to 40C (104F) where I live, and very hot weather can last weeks at a time. Not humid. 

**Vague Plan**: because of the heat, a bit of periodization. JUNE, take advantage of long, still relatively cool evenings to work on building speed with one day hill intervals, one day flat intervals. JULY, spend some  time focusing on heat adaptation in order to be able to maintain volume and fitness. Use the fact that running in heat and direct sun is hard to build resilience; AUGUST take some time off work and go hunting vert in the mountains. Do reccy of some of the race route. SEPTEMBER max training load- build to 8+ per week, do reccy of rest of race route, at least one 5hr+ run to test nutrition, hydration, gear, chafing strategies. OCTOBER taper down to the 16th

ultrarunning,1621477812,"Is a 50mi Too Ambitious For My Running Background? First off, I'm a long time lurker in this community as I have wanted to dip my toe into ultras for the past year or so and keep coming up with excuses as to why I can't. Looking for some advice from much more experiences folks in this community.

# Background

24M. Former college football player and still a much larger than average runner (6'5"", 215lbs). Started running in 2018 to lose weight, ran my first/only marathon in 2019 (4:09), and was planning on running two more in 2020 but, ya know, \*gestures at everything\*

Cumulative miles in 2019, 2020, 2021 are 888, 1614, 780. Average mileage per week so far in 2021 is 40. I'm currently on week six of a slightly modified Pfitz 18/55, so have had mileage of 46, 42, 45, 49, 52, 50 the past six weeks. Taking a cut-back week this week down to \~35 but in general I feel really good. Long Runs are in the 16-18 range right now. I didn't have a race on the calendar when I started this block and was just going to see where it could take me. I set a goal of 3:30 for training paces and so far, it feels like that's about where my fitness is. Long Runs with MP miles within feel tough but I'm not destroying myself to hit the paces. 

# 50k/50mi

Leading to my main question, I'm itching to get back to racing and in specific, ultras. The 50k I am eyeing is on July 3rd about 10mi from my house. It's in a state park that I'm very familiar with but has a relatively hard profile (1423m). It was one that I was training for last spring so I know the climbs and how much is runnable but I haven't been putting in any trail specific work this year.  I'm also thinking about a 50mi (Stewart Tunnel) that is run in Southern WI on August 1st. It has an easier profile (744m) and a generous cutoff (12hrs). My initial plan was to modify the 18/55 plan to incorporate some long runs on the trails and back-to-backs. I would toss most of the MP specific work out the window and do a LT workout during the week with back-to-back LRs on the weekend. I've been practicing fueling but plan to use those LRs as a time to completely dial that in.

My question is: With only 9 weeks to the 50mi race, will I have enough training base to complete the race? Is 15 weeks, peaking around 60-65, enough for my first 50mi? Would it make sense to run the 50k as my last ""workout"" in 6 weeks and then taper?  Like I said, I feel like I'm overthinking and making excuses as to why I can't. I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm either biting off more than I can chew or to just do the damn thing and write a race report afterwards.",0.027,0.91,0.063,0.9658,2617,502,75,27

Race report 24 Hour Run for a Cure:

Bit of a long read sorry.

Background info:

Age: 17

Gender: M

Furthest previous run: 32km in 3 hours

Course was 850m laps of the school fields

Goals: 

1. Finish 24 hours 

2. Complete 100 Km

3. Raise $2000 NZD for cancer support/research

Hours 1-6

Started out at 8.30am with a frost still on the ground. Feet were soaked pretty much straight away, which lead to some rubbing on the inside of my right foot. I band aided up, applied some glide and kept running, as soon as the ground was dry, I changed socks and re did my plasters. Rubbing stopped shortly after and I had no blisters to show but kept the plasters on to be safe. Moved well as was expected, stopping every few Km to grab some apple/orange slices and hydration. Went through the first Marathon in 4.30 and had finished 52 Km at hour 6. I was moving wayyy too fast but some stern words from my coach helped me to focus on the big picture and slow way down. This definitely affected me later, but also meant I had some decent Kms under my belt early.

Hours 7-12

Still jogging most laps with set walking intervals to start with, and everything kept going smoothly till about hour 8.5 when I started getting sharp pains in the top of my right foot. We tried a shoe change, sock change, relaxation techniques and different strapping techniques but not much was helping the pain and it was looking pretty bleak. The sun set and temps dropped right as it was getting really bad which lead to some really slow walked Kms. Luckily at Hour 10ish  we ordered pizzas which was a massive mood boost, and a bunch of students from the dorms came out to run a few laps with me. Shortly after this one of my teachers/ coach tried a new strapping technique which together with a slightly altered running style, reduced foot pain greatly. Stumbled through 82.6km at 12 hours.

Hours 13-18

6 of my running buddies and good friends from school showed up with some tunes and positivity, past half way so my mentality was improving and my foot was feeling better, back to mostly jogging laps with set walking intervals. When they left, they were replaced by teachers and dorm students that had snuck out of bed, cloud cover came in which lifted temperature and hence the mood. One teacher brought a brazier down which was massive. These hours weren‚Äôt very fast but time past quickly and the spirits were high. Food and water was going down well, no blisters to speak of, minimal chaffing and not too much pain. At 1am it started to rain lightly which scared us at first but it held off and only rained very lightly for the next few hours, not enough to cause chaffing or make us cold. 16 hours through I had finished 100km which was incredible feeling, and a massive mood boost. Ticked over 109.4km at the 18 hour mark.

Hours 19-24

Slow slow slow. Lots of walking through these laps. People had started leaving at hour 18 so there was only me and a couple of others for a little while, this was tough on my mind but luckily my swim coach and elite ultra-runner showed up with her dog and some excellent advice and chatter. At 3am people started coming for the morning and this kept me going, though still very slowly. A couple hours before dawn I hit another low point as my foot pain returned and I still had 4 hours to go. Lots of supported acted as if I was already done despite a lot of pain and Kms still to go. Could hardly stand for a while there and was emotionally wrecked at the thought of not finishing after doing so much. Kept moving slowly and held out for dawn, after which my pain started reducing. Walked pretty much all the last 6 hours, but minimized stops between laps. Managed to jog for the last lap before I finished with 132.1 Km. Poured with rain as soon as I finished but I didn‚Äôt care. Drove the 2 mins home and managed to stay awake long enough to shower and pass out.

Ending thoughts

Super happy with how it went overall. Feel a bit like better pace management at the start could have let me run further, but for a first ultra, let alone 24hrs I am super proud of how it went. Even better is the fact that I raised over $3000 for my charity, which is way more than my goal, and I smashed my 100km goal for the run.

I found out about the Bigfoot 40 race, and think it sounds like an awesome stretch goal.

I was looking at the course map and noticed that the first aid station is 12 miles in, the second 14, and the finish 16 from there. So my question is am I crazy to continue training for half marathons like I have in the past, then just run 3 half in a day?

ultrarunning,1620587711,"Race Report- Dirty German 50k Race: 
Dirty German 50K Trail Race in Pennypack Park, Philadelphia
Date: 
May 8th, 2021

Conditions: 
Very Cool, Trails were wet and an absolute mudfest. Several stream crossings, mostly singletrack, several miles of crushed stone/paved bike path along the way. 

Preparation: 
I felt really good heading into my first ultramarathon. My training had hit most of the benchmarks I was hoping for. I kept my mileage fairly low- peaking at little over 50 miles a week (almost all trails) and only running 5 days a week to prevent injury. I put in at least 5 long runs of 20+ miles including¬† a trail marathon 5 weeks prior. Had a good nutrition plan, good taper, good rest. Felt confident. 

Race Day: 
The conditions were much wetter than I expected. Philadelphia had gotten hit with a lot more rain than Delaware the last few days. There would be no dry shoes at any point in the race and the depth of mud/slippage deeply impacted footing, pacing and effort. 

I was fine with letting the leaders get away early on, and settled into a comfortable pace for the first few miles. But after the 2nd mile directly behind two guys, I realized that I was following them too closely, and I wasn't running my own pace. So I sidestepped them and picked things up. Shortly after, a guy passed me (I called him Beardo) and at 4 miles I was tempted to go with him... but this time realized that it was too early and again I needed to run my race, so I let him go. My body felt really great. I was light on my feet and easily able to hop over the deepest mud puddles and jump over logs across the trail (note: this may have been a contributing factor to what happened later).¬† Felt like it made sense to not have my feet more saturated than absolutely necessary. 

I hit my nutrition goals for the first 10 miles and I was right on my goal pace. As early as 13 miles in, people were already coming back to me and I wasn't pushing. I moved from 8th overall to 7th, and then 6th as we hit the halfway point and started on the second loop. Around mile 14, though, I noticed something strange. A couple of times that I stepped up over a log, I felt my right hamstring begin to tighten, nearly seizing up. I wondered if I had gotten dehydrated already or was low on sodium. I tried to stomach some bacon and potato chips at my next Aid station but I hardly got any in. I walked through the aid station and stretched out my leg lightly. I had no idea what was in store.

Still feeling pretty good, around 16 miles I caught back up to Beardo and moved into 5th place. Again, I was feeling fine in every way but my hamstring, fully knowing that there was a lot more racing to do.¬† The miles passed and I held my steady pace, but I was so aware of every time I had to bend my legs extra- going up hills, hopping on a rock or log, and had to be extra careful. 
A few miles later my first big seize up happened. It was around the 21 mile mark. I attempted to jump over a low log, only 8 inches off the ground, and my hamstring locked. I stumbled to the side and yelled, trying to pry my leg back straight and get rid of the cramp. It felt like a baseball formed on the back of my leg under the skin. I've dealt with a little cramping here and there, but nothing like this. At the Aid station at mile 23, my family met me. I needed a short break, so I decided to change out my muddy socks and massage my hamstring a little, hoping that this thing would go away. I stopped for a little less than 2 minutes and took off again. My confidence was fading, but it was clear that I couldn't catch the runners in front of me who were way out there, so my real task was just to hold my position. And I had a big gap over 6th place.¬† I had held an 8:24 pace through the first 22 miles through thick mud, which was right on track for me. But that was when the cramping really hit. 

The last 8 miles were a serious sufferfest.¬† Both hamstrings began to seize regularly. 6 times in the last 8 miles one of my hamstrings locked up completely, sending my shrieking and crashing onto the ground on the side of the trail, rolling on my side and trying to get my leg to straighten back. But when I straightened it out, my quad would lock up. So each time I tried rolling around into a position where the seizing would stop, then carefully find a way to stand back on my feet without letting it lock again, then walk it out, and then gently try to jog again without lifting my leg too high, or it would start all over. So I'd run for a few minutes at a shuffle, then scream, fall over again, then crawl, walk, and get running again. 
This is where the ultra community showed how awesome it is. An older woman doing the 50 miler stopped and gave me salt tabs. Another woman offered me a gel. A guy helped me get up and then did a 20 second fist pound massage on my hamstring. Another guy shot water into my mouth from his hydration pack, since I had dropped mine off earlier (since stations were only 3-4 miles apart). I would get a few minutes of respite, then everything would lock again. But people were SO encouraging. This is where it was a real gift to have the 25k runners and the 50milers on the course at the same time, because otherwise I would have been out there mostly alone. It was also very humbling to appear so pitiful to everyone who ran past. 
At this point, all these guys that I had developed a mile lead on began catching up, as my pace of jogging, falling, stretching, and walking worked out to 11-12 minute miles.¬† I realized my top 5 hope was out of reach, so the goal became to finish my first ultra. There were times in the last two miles that I was yelling at my leg on every step- ""DON'T DO IT! DON'T YOU LOCK UP AGAIN!"" I'm sure I was a real joy to be around at that point. 

It was a fascinating experience, because every time the legs relaxed, I would run past a bunch of people, then they'd pass me again when I lay in the ditch down the trail. They'd say things like, ""man I'm so sorry, hang in there."" And then I would awkwardly pass them again 5 minutes later, only to repeat all over again. 
But when I heard the sound of the accordion player at the finish line, I knew I would finish. My second half of the race was over 25+ minutes slower, which is not normal at all for an even paced runner like I tend to be. But I crossed the line, and the first half of my race proved enough to allow me still hobble into a 10th place overall finish and second in my age group- which means I get a coveted German Weather House award!
I'm still not sure the root of my cramping. Weak hamstrings? Low sodium? Seems strange for salt to be an issue for a cool day of low sweat, where I felt like I was taking in a lot of electrolytes. Simply fatigue? I wonder if jumping over all those logs and leaping around mud puddles early on put a strain on my hamstrings that I didn't realize until later.¬† Or maybe the mud and slick footing made my muscles work much harder than my other marathon distance runs? I really want to figure that out. I've never cramped in a race before, marathon or otherwise. 
Despite the amount of pain, it was a great first experience and left me ready for more. I didn't hit my stretch goals of top 5 and sub 4:30 on this course, but I hit my base goals of finishing, making top 10, and placing in my age group. The ultra community is supportive, fun, and compassionate, and the race was wonderfully organized, despite all the unavoidable mud.¬† My family was incredible in their crewing¬† and encouragement. Can't wait to get back at it in the future.¬† For now, it's time to recover.",0.047,0.838,0.116,0.9988,7611,1459,186,85
ultrarunning,1620586162,"‚ÄúPumped‚Äù calves that won‚Äôt go away? I transitioned from Brooks Cascadias to Altras in November and have been running an average of 25-30mi/week with no issues. I‚Äôve been happy in the altras and love the space and cushion. However, about a month ago, my calves began getting super tight particularly on uphills (I do a good bit of climbing/mountain running) and they‚Äôve only continued to get worse. The tightness definitely correlated with increasing vert, and some speed increase now that trails are melted out, and I‚Äôve been mountain biking a little. So... definitely an up in training load which makes sense, but I‚Äôve been running in the Altras for months without issue so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs poor transitioning (as it is for many). Perhaps I upped my training too much too quick, but it didn‚Äôt feel that way to me... Foam rolling and some PT has helped but I‚Äôm worried because summer is here and I have some ultras coming up and want to be able to keep increasing mileage and vert but am really limited now. My calves tighten up so much and feel pumped like your forearms when you climb a lot, if there are any climbers out here who know the feeling. It‚Äôs awful, and if I don‚Äôt stay on too of rest and rolling and PT, it ends up pulling through my Achilles and heel, which is super concerning. 

My PT said she didn‚Äôt think the shoes were a problem and instead we‚Äôre working on ankle flexion and strength to make sure I‚Äôm not just relying on my calves more than I should. But my friend who was in Altras for a bit said she had the same issue and once she swapped to Hoka Speedgoats it went away. I tried them on and liked the feel, and I like that they‚Äôre still a relatively low drop. I guess I‚Äôm caught up in the zero drop hype but I do like my Altras, and I think they‚Äôve helped my form, but if I can‚Äôt run at all then they definitely aren‚Äôt worth it. Ha! 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has experienced this in the Altras and if so what you did about it. I am super happy to change shoes again (to the Hokas probably) but also don‚Äôt wanna go chasing false solutions if my issue really is just form or something PT can fix.",0.065,0.778,0.157,0.9906,2126,400,52,18

### Beforehand
A month-ish earlier, some previously stable part of my brain decided to go on hiatus and I spontaneously signed up for my first 50K running race, this one conveniently local to my hometown of Syracuse. That first taste of ultramarathoning went swimmingly in most regards; I covered three hilly park loops in just under four hours, with the only caveat coming from a navigation fuckup that left me without an official finish. Ah well.

So, back to the race registration search, looking anywhere within drive-and-one-night-in-a-hotel distance for another 50K in May or June. All of the big and ‚Äúgood‚Äù events were long since full; a couple little oddballs around the area had space, and I settle on the Greater Long Island Running Club‚Äôs (GLIRC) Greenbelt race. The elevation total (~3500 feet) looks the same as what I did in April; it‚Äôs Long Island, that can‚Äôt be that hard, right? Lots of previous years‚Äô winners came through in 4:20s, 4:30s -- holy shit, can I win this thing?

I‚Äôve got plenty of training distance in my legs, hitting 1100 miles for 2021 just before heading over to Long Island. What I don‚Äôt have, though, is a particular focus on elevation or trail running. I‚Äôve been running from my home and around the roads on various loops -- in a flat neighborhood that‚Äôs part of a fairly flat city. In the week-ish between registering and racing, I push myself out a bit to get some more short stretches of singletrack, and even add in a day of hill repeats (three of them!). It‚Äôs obviously far too late to have any physical benefit, but I tell myself I‚Äôll at least be a little more mentally comfortable on race day.

### Getting There
I ask the group chat of teachers in my preschool classroom if anyone else has already put in a time off request for the Friday before the race. Uh, yes, someone does; there goes my morning departure. We do have our awesome occupational therapist coming in to lead an afternoon activity, though, so I at least get to duck out at noon to start my six-ish hour schlep. That, of course, puts me on the inbound George Washington Bridge right at 5:00‚Ä¶ and 5:10‚Ä¶ and 5:20‚Ä¶

I make it to the start point in Plainview, switch from teacher pants into running shorts in a portapotty, and head off on the course with a mix of light jogging the driving malaise out of my legs and also walking/googling nearby pizza places. The ~1.5 miles of trail that I see are smooth dirt, rolling a bit, narrow -- still not my comfort zone of ‚Äúsidewalk‚Äù but definitely doable! Back to the car, pizza acquired, into the hotel with a broken TV and choppy wifi to flop around for a few hours and prep my race day gear.

### Morning Of
I‚Äôm awake right before my 5:30 alarm for the 7:30 start. On the Monday prior, I‚Äôd tried to shift my schedule into morning running to be better prepared for Saturday‚Äôs race; that failed instantly with a flurry of snooze buttons. So, yeah, time for the earliest run start I‚Äôve had in the last ~1.5 years. It‚Äôs an average cloudy morning, perfect for split shorts and short sleeves with some arm warmers I plan to ditch halfway through the race. I check out the various other entrants, recognizing one dude as Jesse, the 2018 winner from race photos, and wonder who else might be up with me trying to finish closer to four hours than to five (or six or seven or eight).

### Leg 1
The out-and-back itself is slightly under 7.5 miles, so our day begins with a bonus paved stretch to hit the full 50K. Sure enough, Jesse is off the front at the start; I‚Äôm behind him by 40ish feet and checking my watch as we hit mile one in sub-7. Oops. I‚Äôm annoyed by the overexcited start, but I‚Äôve done hundreds of road miles at that pace and am not particularly worried about feeling ill effects from it later on.

We lose the pavement and hit the trails just after mile two, covering the same stuff I‚Äôd briefly checked out the night before. Right at mile three is one of the course‚Äôs several uncontrolled road crossings; I catch up to Jesse who‚Äôs stopped and waiting for a gap in traffic, and Ihor, who‚Äôd been a minute or so behind me on pavement, joins us as well.

We eventually make it through that stupid intersection (for the first of four times on the day) and move through the easiest unpaved part of the course with fresh legs in 7:30 and 8:00 miles. One of our trio peels just off-course for a pee break; I wind up leading by a short distance but never out of eyesight, thankfully, because turns out I desperately needed a veteran/local Long Island runner to keep my tourist ass somewhere close to following the course.

And then there‚Äôs Cold Springs Harbor. The handful of random race recaps I‚Äôd read mention the northernmost ~2 miles of the course as the toughest section by far; nothing ungainly in terms of grade or elevation, but plenty of roots and rocks and primitive stairs. My last-minute smooth singletrack practice‚Ä¶ not as relevant here. I shuffle and walk a bit, Ihor blazes past me on one (literally, for him) screaming descent that I take much more cautiously, but I regain my position from him going up a hill and am again in first place at the turn-around aid station.

### Leg 2
Just like in my April 50K, I‚Äôm running essentially gear-less. I‚Äôd dug up ym old water bottle handheld and even tried it out a bit in the week prior before realized I‚Äôd rather take a ten second walk through the course‚Äôs plentiful aid stations as needed rather than carry that dumb thing for four plus hours. Anyway, I take a bit longer than usual at the turn-around for multiple cups of Gatorade, then take back off up the hill right as Ihor is getting in.

I‚Äôm slow and safe through the roots and rocks again, getting to the third-of-the-way point in around 1:25 -- technically right on pace for a 4:15 finish, though there won‚Äôt be any more sub-7 paved miles to help with the cause so in reality I know I'll be closer to 4:30. My focus starts to shift from time to position; how far ahead of Ihor did I leave the turnaround? Jesse is coming the other way not long after my departure. Sure as shit it‚Äôs looking like a three-person race.

I make it out of Cold Springs and settle back into 8:00-ish running through the more reasonable trail sections. I‚Äôm feeling good about making it through one of my two passes of the roots and rocks bullshit‚Ä¶ when I trip over an Invisible Protruding Nothing and fall onto my knee and palm. Ah, shit. I pull myself back up, see a bit of blood starting to form on my knee but overall looks about as harmless as possible. On we go.

25K racers started an hour after the 50K, and they‚Äôre starting to show up on the course now, and of course I‚Äôm also going past the other folks in the 50. I‚Äôm pretty stoked to have them there for two reasons -- first as a couple of dozen people to cheer at me and tell me that I‚Äôm in first, and second as extra things to look for to make sure that I‚Äôm on the course now that I‚Äôm (at least for now) out of sight of Ihor and his superior navigation skills.

I make it to the southern turnaround at mile 16, grabbing my stash of Clif Bloks and a dry hat from my drop bag, leaving behind my soaked-with-sweat arm warmers. I try to gauge just how far I go back north before seeing the other runners; it‚Äôs about a third of a mile for Ihor and close to a full mile for Jesse.

### Leg 3
‚Ä¶ in which I continue to think a lot more about just what I need to do to win the race and less about pace or time.

For now, I‚Äôm still moving decently through the rolling forested miles after the turnaround, more 8:00-ish miles as I reapproach the (ugh) start of Cold Springs Harbor. I tell myself that pushing myself to save two or three or five minutes through this stretch isn‚Äôt going to help me win, but overdoing it and breaking some number of bones in some part of my body after a slip can absolutely make me lose. So, the 9-10-10 mile splits I got on the hills of my first pass through this section become 11-12-10. So it goes.

At the turnaround I chug a third and fourth cup of Gatorade and force some a horrendous Gu packet down my gullet. I grab another Gu before heading out, though honestly if I needed some desperate electrolytes in the last hour I might‚Äôve licked the sweat off my arms before opening up that thing. And back south we go.

### Leg 4
Ihor shows up coming the other way, maybe half a mile up the trail, but it‚Äôs a damn tough half mile and I figure he‚Äôll also need a minute or three at the aid station. Twelve, fifteen minutes ahead? I‚Äôll take that. Beyond the Cold Springs terrain, I start to apply that to how I‚Äôm running the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù trails for the last 10K to the finish. 8ish pace on flats becomes 9ish. Short and steeper rollers become tiny walking breaks. I tell myself I‚Äôm not going to lose my fairly safe lead with a one-hour final 10K, but I absolutely will lose it if I bonk or break something. (Somehow that conservative approach still doesn‚Äôt convince me to eat the stupid final Gu packet, though).

And‚Ä¶ it all works the way I hoped it would. I keep plodding through mile 28, 29, 30, getting back onto some glorious pavement for the half mile to the finish. And then they even have an actual, honest-to-god finish line ribbon waiting for me. Well, more like a finish line vinyl banner. 4:34:12. Book it. I‚Äôll take that voucher good for a pair of Salomon shoes and a gaudy plaque, please.

### Aftermath
I gather a bunch of congratulations and fist-bumps and attaboys from GLIRC people and 25K finishers and graze through their well-stocked snack options -- a 10 foot party sub here, some chips and cookies there, a bunch of water, two cans of Sprite, pizzas show up a bit later‚Ä¶ good, good shit. Ihor, sure and steady enough, arrives second, somewhere in the 4:50s.

I still might try to squeeze in another East Coast 50K before my wife and I move out of the area this summer. I turned in my first place shoe certificate for a pair of Salomon trail shoes -- maybe it‚Äôs time to explore whether basically every single other runner in this GLIRC event had the right idea about footwear and I‚Äôm being the weirdo for wearing lightweight road shoes on trail ultras. On the other hand, I did win the damn thing, so‚Ä¶

But that‚Äôs future stuff. After a few more rounds of the snack tables, I reluctantly and gingerly re-loaded my car and headed back to Syracuse. Traffic was mercifully light going west through the city on a Saturday afternoon -- I think I‚Äôd used up all my foot and ankle muscles on those goddam roots and rocks and was not really on board for another half hour of working the clutch pedal through stop-and-go bridge traffic.

I spent a few days at Cocodona last weekend and while the race was absolutely incredible, I found the cost of entry quite deterring. It got me thinking about some of the ultra-distance races in cycling, like the Tour Divide, or GB Duro, where there is technically a race happening, but really it's just people racing from one location to the other with no support. We have FKT's in ultrarunning, but I've never heard of a large group of people racing the PCT, for example, or some other long trail in self supported fashion.

Furthermore, I wonder what the legal implications are? As long as there are no crews and aid stations, can you even legally organise an event that involves people going through wilderness areas? Even if it's just like 15 people who were invited via Facebook? You can backpack with a group of friends, so at what point is it not allowed?

The area I‚Äôm looking for guidance is the long, drawn-out, pseudo-hills where it‚Äôs not quite steep enough to require walking, but it‚Äôs got too much of an incline to run without expending precious energy. 

I‚Äôve got a 100-mile race in August that has what seems to be two forever climbs that I think I‚Äôm drastically underestimating. I‚Äôm good with huge elevation gains, but I seem to struggle with prolonged gradual climbs. The first climb is almost 25 miles long and is only \~4200 feet of elevation. But each mile gradually climbs between 100-250 feet/mile for a net uphill effect that is relentless. The second climb is about 30 miles of the same, 100-250 feet/mile elevation change. These occasionally have breaks but for the most part they are dauntingly consistent. I‚Äôm wondering if there is a technique to improve upon this skill?

Date: 10/2/2021

Background: I completed the PM2HR 50 Miler 2 years ago in 13:48. It was my first 50 miler. I have previously completed a marathon and a Spartan Ultra (50k), so I do have some experience with ultra distances just not a ton. I am signed up to run the race again this year. My running has been very inconsistent after I ran the race 2 years ago. I blame my 16 month old son mostly. However, I have been running regularly in 2021. I am currently averaging about 20 mpw.

I just ran a half marathon with a pace of about 12:30/mile at a moderate-hard effort for me ‚Äî I've been utilizing a run/walk for training and continued it for the race. I've been training on roads this season, but previous trail runs I've done have easily put me in the 15-20+ minute/mile range even with relatively mellow elevation gain. 

I have three months to train on trails, practice power hiking, downhills, and time on feet‚Äîbut I'm freaking out that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of making the cutoff for the 50k I signed up for, the Wy'East Howl, which has 6,000 feet of gain and 5,000 feet of descent with two cutoffs - 6.5 hours to reach the 20.7 mile marker, 10 hours for the total race.

(Re: athletic background‚ÄîI backpacked 1,000 miles in a summer a few years ago, but mileage was usually ~15-20 and I had the security of taking as long as I wanted. Current easy running pace is like 13:30/mile on roads.)

I've always been slow at every sport, so while I'm confident I could build myself up to a 50k distance, I'm significantly less confident that I could do it within 10 hours.

I don't know much else about him. His Youtube-channel has only been active for about a month, but I watched his videos (IN DANISH!) on training, and he talks about:

- Long term planning: How to ramp up volume over the years from being a casual runner (less than 50K per week) to being an enthusiastic casual runner/casual ultrarunner (100 K per week), maybe even to international level athlete (140K per week in the off season).  
- Shorter term planning: Ramping up/down volume during the year, when to peak and rest and the importance of recovering for 3 months a year at (for example) half volume  
- Long distance training runs
- Tempo runs for ultrarunners: From classical tempo runs (1 min on/off) over medium/long intervals (1-5K) to very long tempo runs (20 to 65K)
- Injury prevention and early signs of fatigue, including persisting mood changes to more concrete physical signs of fatigue to chronic injury, with the main point being: Injuries do not usually appear because of a single run/session. They appear because you ignored signs or didn't realise early enough.
- Mental strength and fueling during runs (while the concepts are universally applicaple, I'm not personally convinced the specific content in these videos is as high quality as the training videos).

The training videos are probably only useful for other scandinavians (unless someone chooses to create subtitles for them), but his videos about the world runs are in english, and to me it seems like he want's to tell his stories, so more videos are probably coming.",0.046,0.877,0.077,0.9053,2413,379,57,15

ultrarunning,1619811975,"I ran a Half Marathon while on Acid yesterday Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I consider myself an ultra runner I train for Ultras and I love long-distance running and I just really wanted to share this with people who love running as much as I do. 

I posted this in the running subreddit but they deleted it, unfortunately. I'm just going to copy and paste it here if that's okay?

Yesterday, 4/29/21, I ran 13.4 miles while on acid. I want to write about it because honestly, I've never experienced anything like I did yesterday and it was such an amazing experience. I've done acid a lot over the past few years, but almost every time I did it it was in a party environment or on my own in a bedroom. I love running, like a lot. Like when I think of myself as a person the first thing that pops up in my head to describe myself to others is that I'm a runner. Not a very good runner, but a runner who loves to run.

I really had no goals in mind with this run other than to be as careful as I could and to just enjoy myself. To enjoy my feet below me carrying me wherever I will them too. I didn't have a time limit I barely took any precautions. I had never done anything like this before. It was all very spur of the moment and I hardly did any planning or preparing whatsoever.

I got up for work at 3:15 am and got home from work around 6:40 pm. I knew that I was going to be tired and that I'd need to take the acid as soon as I got home so that I could still be running when the acid finally hit me. I started my run just after 7 pm Thursday afternoon.

Miles 1-3 They felt very similar to the beginning of every run. I wasn't tripping yet so I mostly focused on stretching my legs out and keeping a slow and easy pace. I followed the train tracks out of my small rural town that I live in and just kept running beside them for miles. Until the closest road was over 3 miles away and I was just in farmland.

Mile 4 About an hour or so after I took the acid. I could feel it coming on now and just felt incredibly light, happy, and proud. I was proud that I was running. I was proud that I worked an entire day and still decided to run a half marathon. I was proud of this crazy little trip I decided to take.

Mile 5-6 This is my favorite part of my run. I was surrounded by nature. River, swamp, farmland, open sky. For a brief moment, it all felt like mine. It felt right. I didn't want to leave but the sun was going down and I needed to make it home because I left my headlamp at home because I was in such a rush to start my run. Before I reached my halfway point I saw a white tail deer running like 25-30 yards to my north and ran with her for a while. I tried to get a picture of her or a video but I couldn't because I am stupid lol. Snapchat video of my favorite part

Mile 7-8 I was tripping. I ran along the train tracks and was mesmerized by the long golden grains of grass following the breeze in the wind. They all looked the same to me. Every piece standing tall and proud reaching towards the sky and the breeze from the south and east blowing them in the same direction of my home. I followed the dancing grass. I watched the birds take off on flight in front of me. I watched them jet off into the sky and effortlessly carry themselves on the wind. I felt very similar to them. Their wings are to them and the sky as my legs are to me and the ground.

Miles 9-11 The train tracks brought me up alongside small bodies of water and it was really, really hard to focus on my running because each wave and ripple on the water just grabbed my attention. Demanded that I look at it and appreciate the beauty I found myself alone and surrounded by. During this portion of the run, I would fall 4 times. 2 hard falls and a cracked phone screen made me realize I was flying. I wasn't jogging or slowly running I was straight up sprinting and I didn't even realize it. Running fast while sober is great and fun. Running fast while on acid is on another level completely. The sun was going down and I was bleeding, cold, excited, and happy.

Miles 12-13 I was coming back into town. Following the sunset. The incredible colors painted in the sky and the clouds make me wish I could paint because I feel the only way I'd be able to describe this sunset is on canvas. The blues slowly turning into various shades of purples, pinks, oranges, reds, and yellows was a perfect view to follow back into town. The smells and sights once I was back in town were very different from the rest of my run understandably. I ran along the train tracks towards the old co-op. Before I got there I had to run behind a gasoline station and I could smell the fried chicken and cheese curds they had for sale the smells filled me up and encouraged me to run home so that I could make french fries. By the dumpsters behind the gasoline station were piles of sand and cigarette butts from where the ashtrays were dumped. I felt sad and also proud. I felt sad because I used to be a part of that group. I used to smoke from 15-23 I have just quit smoking a little over 3 months ago. Running past those piles of cigarette butts helped remind me that me quitting smoking wasn't just going to have a positive impact on my life but all of the lives around me. I'm proud that I quit smoking and I will say that it is hard and it sucks at times, but that it's worth it just like running is to all of us.

Miles .4 Running. I did not want to stop but the sun was going down and even though for me it is normal to run and to sometimes do acid I'd never mixed both before. I didn't want the fun to stop but I knew that my neighbors wouldn't appreciate a crazy young man running around the streets after dark while he was tripping balls on acid. So I did the only other thing I could do. I went home and hopped in the shower to wash the blood, sweat, dirt, and rust off of my exhausted body. Guys before I hopped in the shower I stood naked in front of my mirror and was so happy. I looked at my body, my face, my legs. I felt so proud of myself. Of the power in my legs. The goofy smile I had melted onto my face. I have never in my life felt as happy as I did standing in front of my mirror naked, coming down from this incredible runner's high, and watching the walls and ceiling breathe with me.

I watched documentaries after my shower and before falling asleep. I think what I learned the most from yesterday is that I take too much for granted and that I don't appreciate what I have. I am very lucky and I believe so are most of you.

I think that if I never do acid again I'd be okay with it because yesterday, honestly was life-changing and I need more time to analyze myself and to keep doing what drives me.

I have been experiencing a lot of knee pain recently on my right knee and have no idea what it could be and wonder if I should be concerned or if it is just overuse. The pain occurs right below my kneecap almost around the patellar ligament and to the tibia/top of the shinbone. I should mention I feel 0 pain while running. However, I have started playing basketball again and the pain happens mainly when I play basketball. If I do a stepback, jump or a hard cut where I plant hard on that knee/leg, it will feel like it just gives out with quite a bit of sharp pain. The pain goes away quickly, but it will give out and cause pain at random times while I play. Occasionally, it will hurt if I try and get up from sitting or laying down and put all the pressure on that knee/leg. If I press hard on it, the top of the tibia/shin bone will become irritated.

Last August I DNFed about 60 miles in during my first attempt at running a 100 miler. It was over the same weekend as the North Downs Way 100 - some of you might remember how hot it was! The heat really messed with my nutrition plan and I stopped at the advice of my crew after I was showing signs of heat exhaustion (definitely the right call!). I've certainly learned a lot from the whole experience, particularly regarding nutrition; I didn't have a backup plan, so once I started feeling nauseous enough that I couldn't keep down solid food I began to lose the battle against the bonk. 

I took the whole thing pretty badly in the aftermath, because had I tried it on a cooler day things might have gone a little differently (especially annoying because I felt like my legs had so much left in them!). I sort of lost interest in running afterwards - until recently!

It feels like that ""spark"" which spurred me through the training last year is back. I've been upping the mileage over the past few weeks, and after completing only a few longer-distance runs since August I went out and ran 50k today! It was the first time I'd done more than 20ish miles since then, and it felt amazing to be back out there. 

I'm actually signed up the NDW100 this coming August and I'm finally feeling motivated about the training. I think that going into this training block I'm actually in a better position than last year because of all the lessons I learned from the DNF.

## Training

I had an issue with my knee that made it so I was unable to run for most of December 2020. By early January, I was able to start building up mileage. I gradually worked up to \~70 miles a week throughout most of March. I was doing cross training on Mondays, tempo runs on Tuesday/Thursdays, easy run on Wednesdays, long run on Saturdays, and a moderate length run on Sundays . During this block, I was also doing some strength training based on information from David and Megan Roche's Happy Runner.

Toward the end of last year I also started paying more attention to cadence and found that I was usually averaging around 150 steps per minute on my typical training runs. Since then, I have been trying to gradually increase that number. I worked up to close to 160 for most of this training block and am planning to work that number up for future blocks.

I had attempted this same route, in the opposite direction, back in August of last year and had to give up about 46 miles into it after dealing with dehydration due to not having enough water to work through the heat.

## Pre-run

I was thinking the route was going to take me between 12 to 16 hours to complete so I setup my pack to have all the food I would need for 17 hours just to be on the safe side. I have done a couple other ultras and have had luck with rotating peanuts, energy gels, and bits of a Clif bar around every 20 minutes, so I used that same strategy for this event. I used the Salomon Adv Skin 12 which had enough room for that food, some first aid supplies, and my 0.6L Katadyn BeFree. I filled up the two 0.5L soft flasks and the Katadyn before starting.

For my attempt in August 2020, I filled up water bottles at drinking fountains along the way. The water fountains were not turned on during this attempt, so I had to rely on pulling water from rivers and lakes with the Katadyn.

The temperatures were going to go from cloudy and 32F in the morning up to 55F and sunny at the hottest part of the day. I started with a warm hat, jacket, and gloves with the plan that I would eventually take off as it got warmer out.

I didn't set any goal time, because I did not want to have any reason to push the pace beyond what I was finding comfortable at the time.

During last year's failed attempt I ran from Gaylord up to Mackinaw City since getting to finish in front of the Mackinaw Bridge seemed like a nice way to close out the day. This time I went Mackinaw City to Gaylord since Gaylord had better post-run vegetarian food options open at the time. The trail is pretty flat so it didn't make a big difference to me running-wise which direction I ran it.

## Run

# Mackinaw City to Cheboygan ‚Äì 16.3 miles

My wife dropped me off at 5am at the trailhead. I started out with a plan of alternating 9 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. The entire trail is flat so I wanted some ability to mix in walking since there are no hills to hike up. This section was just a straight shot with some trees on either side of the path and the occasional views of Lake Huron. It was rather uneventful as I was able to stick to my eating and drinking plan and kept the pace easy. Highlights included a beautiful sunrise and numerous deer, raccoon, and turkey spottings.

# Cheboygan to Topinabee ‚Äì 11.9 miles

In Cheboygan, there was a nice facility next to the path that had benches and, in the warmer months, a drinking fountain and bathroom. I used this as an opportunity to switch out my warmer hat and gloves with some lighter ones. I also refilled my two front bottles with what I had stored up in the Katadyn.

Most of this stretch runs along Mullet Lake. The sun started to poke out and there were tons of beachy segments with minimal shade. I was able to find a public boat launch into Mullet Lake where I used the Katadyn to refill all my bottles. I ended up getting one foot soaked, which was a little annoying for a few miles, but then it dried out.

# Topinabee to Indian River ‚Äì 5.6 miles

There was a nice spot to stop and sit along the path in Topinabee, but I ended up moving past since Indian River was not far ahead and I had just made a stop to fill up bottles. I was able to mostly keep up my pace and eating plan, but started working in some more frequent stretching as I was starting to get more sore.

# Indian River to Wolverine ‚Äì 9.6 miles

My pace started slowing down a bit here as I was starting to have a tougher time taking in enough water and eating with the heat. I feel like 55F and sunny is probably not too hot for most people, but to a person who had been been training through a Michigan winter the past few months it was hitting me hard. I stopped at the Rondo bridge to sit down, refill all the water bottles, and move some food around.

# Wolverine to Vanderbilt - 10.9 miles

This is where I really started to have some issues.  The sun was beating down pretty hard and I was having a tough time finding a spot to refill water. I was trying to make my water stretch out as best I could, but was definitely not taking in the water I needed. During this time, I kept increasing the amount of time I was walking relative to running. Just as I was switching to only walking, I ended up finding a creek in the shade that looked like it was moving just quickly enough to be alright to filter. I ended up spending some time just sitting in the shade and trying to catch up on food and water intake.

After the break, I started to feel better as I got more water into my system. I was ended up working back to an 8 minute run and 2 minute walk plan.

# Vanderbilt to Gaylord - 7.6 miles

I took one last sitting break in Vanderbilt to recover, shuffle some food/trash around my pack, and move the water from the Katadyn to the front bottles. At this point, my legs were pretty sore. I was getting occasional cramps in my thighs and calves that I was able to walk and stretch my way out of. Besides the cramps, I was able to push through with a relatively consistent 4 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. I had a group of cows come right up to their feeble-looking fence along the path and stare at me, which made me slow to a cautious walk as I passed them.

After a long day, the idea of just being done took over and I ended up picking up the pace to run my quickest pace of the day and was greeted by my wife with some water, fresh snacks, and new clothes.

## Post-run

We got takeout from Snowbelt Brewery. I got a tater tot waffle covered in mac and cheese. I had a tough time sleeping between feeling too hot or too cold and just general soreness. I was pretty sore the whole next day, but doing some walking, stretching, and using a massager on my legs helped me feel quite a bit better by the end of the day.  The next day I went on a 2 mile run and that really helped speed up the recovery.

I plan on submit the activity to fastestknowntime.com.

I ran my first 50k last year in the Shifts and they performed well on light trail and road. However, much of my training this year will be on trail, culminating in an 80km trail run on highly technical trail. Thus, I need some proper trail shoes.

### A seed was planted
Four years ago a physio introduced me to the idea of ultras:
‚ÄúI was hallucinating by the second night. I tried as hard as I could to descend a never-ending mountain, but it felt like I was under water. It took me hours to realise I had been striving to run uphill, not down‚Äù.

I asked what the event was called, and he said The Alpine Challenge. His calm recollection of these absurd impressions intrigued me. I also felt a stab of terror, because I knew that I might be tempted, and saw a possible fate unroll into the future.

### Build-up
Oct 2019: first ultra.

Feb 2020 - Feb 2021: a fantastic set of uninterrupted training blocks between solo ultras. Usually 100k (60M) weeks with ~3000m (10,000ft) of elevation and regular unfocused speedwork. Two overnight adventures including my first 100 mile run.

I worked up to steeper and sketchier terrain than I would encounter in the Alpine Challenge. I linked up appealing remote features through trial and error. This experimentation required problem solving, and conditioned me (to a degree) to exposure as I practised scrambling and basic climbing. I hoped this approach would limit my fears about the race, but I was still very afraid!

The last two months forced me to skip most speedwork, almost all strength training and my peak mileage weeks. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd be able to race even 24hrs before the event. I felt lucky when things aligned and I got the all clear to race.

### About The Race
The Alpine Challenge is a glorious loop that passes through some of the most spectacular country in Australia. The course crests three of the highest peaks in the area: Bogong, Hotham and Feathertop (each is ~2000m or 6,500ft). Its trails are mostly soft underfoot as it travels sparse alpine landscapes, rainforest, misty eucalypt valleys and jagged rocky spurs.

The course is famously hard, even to international runners that are comfortable in higher mountains. People struggle with the snow and fog, the cold, the navigation, the steep rocky descents and the long climbs. In 2019 the DNF rate was above 50%.

### My race
We began in the dark. An icy river crossing shortly after sunrise preceded the first major climb.

There I bumped into a friendly runner I‚Äôd met once before. He was friendly, inquisitive and interesting. This was his first miler, and he‚Äôd trained well. He too hoped for sub-30 hours, but not at the cost of a DNF - my approach exactly. We ran together and talked. This pleasant chatty vibe was refreshing. I‚Äôd never raced with anyone before.

Two loyal helpers had taken time off work and driven seven hours to support my new friend. Their job might have been harder than ours - they were up at three AM and spent the day driving hours between aid stations. I saw up close how selfless and inspiring that is, and how much he appreciated it. I was quite moved. His friends were funny as fuck, which was a nice counter point to our sincere banter.

One of them joined us as pacer for the last third of the race. Have you ever tried to keep a three year old focused on one task for twelve hours? That‚Äôs how hard his job was.

At midnight we encountered civilisation - the Harrietville Hotel, a gorgeous pub in a small town which was doubling as an aid station. People often quit here. You‚Äôre about 120k in (75M), broken, and nestled in a nice pub between two mountains in a chair by a fire. There is laughter and the sound of beer glasses chinking.  Who in their right mind would leave this heavenly environment to begin the biggest climb and the hardest section of the course. It‚Äôs midnight, it‚Äôs freezing.

Luckily I have been warned about the seductive dangers of ch√§r by ultra running memes. Chair is dangerous. Chair will swallow you. Must leave chair.

One of my friend‚Äôs crew chased me down the street as we left the pub:
‚ÄúDo you want these?‚Äù
He was holding out my thermals and my water bladder.

The next 13km were all uphill. My headtorch died. My backup headtorch died. My friend offered me his backup headtorch and it died. I used my iphone‚Äôs torch, but the temperatures caused the battery to plummet, so I walked in the dark between my friend and his pacer, rhythmically stepping off the trail to plan footsteps in the torchlight behind me.

Mt Feathertop‚Äôs imposing silhouette appeared when we cleared the treeline, illuminated by the most stars I‚Äôd ever seen. I saw a shooting star. This was the moment for me when the race delivered everything I‚Äôd hoped for. Three people about to bag a peak at 4am, in the middle of nowhere, under the milky way.

The sunrise from Diamantina Spur was equally beautiful, on all scales from the psychedelic wild flowers and swirling rock formations at my feet to the plunging spur we stood on, to the valley below and the mountains above it, and the profile of Feathertop around us, which we‚Äôd just been up. I fucking love my life sometimes. I laughed at how bad my photos were and soaked it in.

If I wanted the sub-30 finish I knew I‚Äôd have to maintain a normal weekend long-run pace for the last four hours. Going off on my own didn‚Äôt feel right though after twenty four hours of solidarity. The clinching factor was that Strava had shat itself and lost my entire recording. If I ran with my buddy I could tag myself in his recording.

I re-joined my friends and we pushed up the last big climb. Our pacer silently coaxed us into properly running the last 15km (~10M), including all of the uphills. I was happy to be pushing because I knew it would likely stop us from being overtaken, and I calculated that we had a top twenty spot. Wholesome to see my new friend was tearing up and relishing his experience. He held my hand to cross the finish line, but it turned out to be 100m too early. We awkwardly unheld hands, then held them again.

Someone put a beer in my hand. Neither of us puked or bled. Success!

Details:

* 4.2 mile trail loop. Trails are wide and heavily groomed (imagine woodchipped roads) and hilly. 
* Past winner ended up at 134 miles

&gt; Racing starts at 12 noon on Saturday with a shotgun start. Racers will complete the course at whatever pace they choose, but they MUST complete the loop in less than 60 minutes! Those that complete the course in under an hour will earn the right to continue. The next gun start is at 1pm. Same loop, same rules apply. The race continues in this format until there is only one athlete remaining. The lone athlete must be standing at the starting line ready for the next start to be declared the Last Man Standing and the winner.


Questions:

* How to properly train for this event?
    * Do I concentrate on overall mileage, with long back to backs?
    * Do I train similar to the race structure with same day back to backs?
* Any strategies for this type of event?

This obviously doesn't work the same when you are doing your training runs on hilly technical trails where a 10k run which would take you 40 minutes on the road takes you an hour and a half on the trails. 

Specifically I am following Hal Koerner's book where his plans are based on mileage.  Is the assumption that you would just run those miles on the same ""type"" of trails you would run the race on?  So if it says to go for an 8 mile run, that run should not be on a flat road but on the similar trail (vertical gain/loss, roots, rocks etc.) as the race?  It obviously vastly changes the amount of time you spend running depending on where you do your run.  It could potentially take you over twice as long to do the same weekly program depending on if you just go out and do the miles on the road or the miles on the trails.

Thank you to all those who have participated so far . Those who have not yet participated, please consider doing so. Thank you.*

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation.

While research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. To this end I have designed a survey and I would like to enlist your kind help. I believe that this subReddit is the perfect venue.

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will be using  the data to write several research overviews. When the analysis is completed, I will be only too happy to report back in this subReddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html)

If you are over 18 yrs of age, would you mind participating by filling out the survey, please?

The survey can be found at this link:

[https://www.research.net/r/AdvOutRecOSr](https://www.research.net/r/AdvOutRecOSr)

The survey should take about 20-25 min to complete.

There is  no 'right' or 'wrong' answer. It is all about your perception of risk.

Mobile device users please be aware that SurveyMonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll horizontally or down as well to see everything. I apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

I am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but I can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

I know the only thing more annoying than asking for shoe advice is asking ‚Äòwhy does my knee hurt?‚Äô, but I‚Äôve got a more general query than just looking for shoe recommendations.

I began my trail running about 18 months ago in a pair of Salomon Sense Ride 2‚Äôs, which have been really good to me. After putting many hundreds of km‚Äôs through them, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs time for a new pair of shoes. 

I went straight for the Sense Ride 4‚Äôs, since that is the current iteration, but found that they seem far more firm under foot than the 2‚Äôs, so I‚Äôve been turned off them. So now I‚Äôm cast out into the the big wide world of shoes, with endless options at my fingertips - Altra‚Äôs, Hoka‚Äôs, many shiny new things catching my eye.

I have, however, also been able to find a pair of the ole reliable 2‚Äôs online - seemingly one of the last few floating around. Given I have gone 18 months (touchwood) injury free and with no major issues or hotspots/blisters etc. in them, I assume they‚Äôre good shoes for me - but because I started my running journey in them, I just don‚Äôt know how much ‚Äòbetter‚Äô things could be, because I‚Äôve never tried anything else. 

I guess the crux of my question is: how value is a reliable shoe? Is it a case of ‚Äòstick with it at all costs, because they‚Äôre like gold‚Äô, or is it ‚Äòbranch out, because it‚Äôll be okay and you‚Äôll most likely be fine with your new shoes (or even better)‚Äô?

I know the answer is situational, so here is a bit of context. I've raced one ""virtual"" 55mi, two 50k's, two traditional marathons, several 18mi races over the last 5 years. Over the winter I completed a running series where I ran five \~20mi trail runs- one a month from Sept through Jan. I understand nutrition and have started running some trail runs in the dark. My last 50mi training program topped at 70 miles per week. I was able to train injury free. 

When I Google ""training plan 100 mi ultra"" I find a general lack of information. The most common recommendation is to hire a coach. I am the sole breadwinner of a family of 4. And a teacher's salary doesn't leave me with any discretionary spending. There are a few plans out there... that I would need to alter to better suit my needs. But I am willing and able to take a basic template and rewrite it to my needs. So if I could do without a coach, is there a suggestion where to look for 100mi training plans?

ultrarunning,1617214736,"Planning logistics (post-run nutrition and care) for multi-day marathon series I'm really not sure where to get the most exposure for this ( r/Ultramarathon, r/AdvancedRunning, here...), but in any case...

I'm doing the New England Challenge this May (6 days, 6 states, marathon each day). December 2019, I did Four Corners series (similar idea...4 states, 4 days) except for that series I had my parents with me. This was huge because they drove us to/from each day and helped me make food each evening (we stayed in an AirBNB).

This time, I am traveling solo. I will be traveling to a new hotel each day, travel times between race locations will be anywhere between 30 minutes and 2 hrs.

I know from Four Corners that things I've got to do as soon as I get to the hotel are: some movement/walking, extra foam rolling, slap on my AirRelax boots, eat some food, and take a nap. I also know I need to plan some extra food on the drive between hotels. I realize I'll be burning a lot of calories each day, but I also don't think I should just plan to eat pizza/quick gas station food each day either. That seems like it will catch up with me by day 4-6. I also learned that while I needed to eat, at the end of the day, my ability to eat a lot was somewhat limited, so calorie dense is a bonus (I did a lot of tuna pasta salad during Four Corners).

I'm looking for advice on  
\- Easy road foods that I can either make the night before in a hotel room for post-race travel (was thinking maybe PB&amp;J sandwiches)?  
\- Food for eating in the afternoon/evening to refuel once I'm at the hotel. Hopefully things that I might be able to make prior to leaving and will keep for a little over a week (I'm driving, so I can pack a cooler). Or things that I can have the components and can easily make in the hotel.  
\- Other food/nutrition options that I should plan to bring with me. I won't have anyone to make a grocery run for me, so the less I need to travel out after each day, the better it seems.  
\- Anything else I should consider in terms of logistics.  
\- Contingency planning: What should I do if I get to next hotel and I can't check in for a few hours

I'm confident in my ability to tackle the series since I did Four Corners, which was much more technically difficult running (trails, lots of elevation), but I don't have much prior experience with regards to logistics of making this as easy for myself to be successful managing it. For what it's worth also, I'm hoping to finish in about 5hrs for each day of racing.",0.015,0.871,0.114,0.9935,2535,475,74,22

GoalDescriptionCompleted?AFinish*Yes*BEnjoy it*Yes*

### Training

I posted at the beginning of the month here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/lupzl1/challenge\_496\_advice\_required/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/lupzl1/challenge_496_advice_required/)

I have consistent 50k weeks over the last 9 months but this was a last minute idea and i am not sure how i would even train for it. A huge step

### Pre-race

I had a down week to prepare but nothing else to note. A huge part of this challenge would be logistics and i am working from home due to lockdown, we have a 4 month old baby, a dog and my wife (freelancer) is back working nights. This led to a pretty mad schedule as the month progressed where our day looked like this:

7.00am - Get baby up, have something light to eat

8:00am - Nanny arrives and i run for 60 mins with dog

9-12 - work, sneak out for lunch run, wife gets up

5:00pm - nanny leaves, i take baby out for run (catnap) + dog

6-7.15pm - bedtime etc for baby

7.30pm we eat

9:00pm I go to bed, wife leaves for work

2:00am - i do night feed

5:00am - wife gets back from work, i get up and run 

7:00am - i get baby up...

Due to this slightly bonkers schedule i knew i could not 1 bang each run as there was no way i could get 2+ hours free at one time. Therefore, i planned to split days into multiple runs.

I had two pairs of shoes to rotate between, Reebok Floatride Energy 3 Shoes and NB 1080 v11's.

I tried to do a 15 minute flexibility routine each day (bodyweight warrior on youtube) but this did fall away as the month went on. I concentrated on stretching my glutes and used a massage gun on my calves

### Race

I nailed day 1! My plan was to run at a really low heart rate (i use Garmin 945 + chest strap) with a target HR of &lt;130. This equates to 6 minute km's for me, slower with baby in tow.

I chugged away through the first 2 weeks with no dramas. Mentally i felt like day 21 would be the first mental barrier and that was my goal. I had a post run mini bonk on about day 17 which was a reminder of how important hydration is - lesson learnt. Once a day, after the longest run, i would take some SiS Rego powder with frozen berries and milk as my recovery drink + a hydration tablet. Other than that i just ate a normal diet - i did eat whatever i wanted, whenever i wanted. Interestingly i put on about 1kg during this but am not sure if it is my body freaking out or just me going a bit mad with Deliveroo. 

Running with a running buggy is hard, especially 15k+ and i really felt it in my glutes on the next non buggy run. This would have been impossible with a running buggy and it was enjoyable to share the experience with the baby. 

I listened to alot of podcasts, audiobooks and Spotify during the runs using Aftershokz headphones which i would highly recommend. 

I did day 25 in a 1 bang before work as my wife wasnt working and felt great, the next goal being getting to the 27th as this was the weekend which was normally easier. Unfortunately the baby got a cold which meant he stopped sleeping more than an hour which left me running on fumes somewhat. This challenge was never going to be straightforward and i kept positive, ticking off the runs and the days.

I found the 28th to be the hardest as i had a couple of beers the night before, no sleep and the cumulative effort was telling. The 3rd run of the day, a 9k with running buggy was seriously hard but once done i knew i would finish the whole thing.

I took day 31 off work so i could do it in 1 and met my cousin who was also doing the challenge. We  chatted round and i enjoyed the last 5k on my own. I really enjoyed the interest and support on Strava/friends/work and wanted to write this up to share the idea and see if anyone else wants to take it on.

### Post-race

I have a bottle of bubbles in the fridge and am going to nail a pizza tonight. I reckon i will be asleep before the 2nd glass and 3rd slice!

I have no real injuries to report, just a few niggles but thats to be expected. I have a small blister on my left foot and i bruised the top of my right foot on about day 27 as either i did my laces up too tight or my foot swelled up (or both). I plan to take the next two week easy but do lots of walking and active recovery and then do a 70k run in June.

I've had a strange bump appear on my left foot after having run 11 miles back in December and it does not want to go away.

2 weeks off from running has me slipping. When running has saved you from past vices, they come rising back when running is not there. First week off was not so bad. Substituting with biking was fun, but only because I thought I might return to running the next week or week after next.

Do you run more races or self-supported ultra's to keep your fitness at that kind of level, or do you drop the weekly distance back down to be more 'convienient' with normal daily life and then build up again for the next event?

ultrarunning,1615918173,"How I won the first ultramarathon I ran (50 miles) race recap/my training Hello ultrarunners of reddit- new member here, so great for us to have this community! 

Last week I ran my first ever 50 mile ultramarathon (St. George Lake to Lake 50 mile) and somehow managed to swoop in for 1st place in the women's ultra. Ran 9:43, which I know is not such a crazy amazing time to write home about, I was a bit disappointed since I had planned to not only break 9 hours, but really wanted to break 8 hours.... and I thought I could based on my training... but things don't always go how you plan them. 

Training: 

First off, really stepped up my weekly volume from previously 45-60 MPW, gradually going all the way up to 80 MPW. That was definitely scary for me, but my body adapted so well, I honestly felt like I could've done more, but of course, since it was my first ultra, I didn't want to push things and get injured. 

2) I really amped up my strength training for this training block. Previously, when I finally managed to qualify for Boston (3 times now) I noticed adding a little bit of strength training to my routine paid out HUGE dividends, so I decided if I really wanted to run longer, faster, and stronger, I needed to kick it up a notch in that department. I pretty much doubled the length of my workouts (squats, lunges, core work, resistance band training for hips and glutes etc.) and added more plyo training i.e. jump squats. After mostly all of these workouts I was sore the next day, but I tried to balance it (with decent success) so that I wouldn't be so sore that when I went to run it would get in the way. After I got warmed up the soreness would quiet down. 

3) Speed work 2x a week with lots of variety. Sometimes longer tempo runs, some progression runs, mile repeats, yassos, just tried to switch it up every week to something different. 

4) long runs. I did back to back long run every weekend (shorter 10-15 mile distance on Sat and then 30-40 mile distance on Sunday). Basically all of my long runs (maxing out at 10/40 back to back Saturday/Sunday) I was able to run at 9:30 or less a mile. So I was really planning on running under 8 hours on the race. Sadly, on dice for me this time around. I really wish somehow I could've gotten some heat training in... I knew my race was going to be in St. George, but it was March and I was hoping the heat wouldn't really hit me this early in the year. But alas, giant heat wave came in just the weekend of my race bringing temps from mid 50s up near the 80s just for me. That pretty much killed me for a good 3 hours where I was running 12 minute miles.  

Race Day: 

Got started at 7am at killed it, right on target pace for the first 25 miles. I was doing great on hydration, nutrition, heart rate zone, no blisters, everything... Of course then day heated up and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I kept dunking my shirt in water to keep myself cool, but it was still brutal. I do badly in the heat just in general, way worse than the average runner. But especially coming from training all winter long in Utah (my hottest run was when I trained on the course 3 weeks prior and it was 50 degrees) I just couldn't handle it very well. I did manage to keep running, at least, never had to stop and walk (other than very short intervals on really steep and gravelly hills where I just felt like running was inefficient). But in the end, it didn't matter too much as it turned out the women's field competition was not very steep, and 9:43 was enough to snag 1st place after all. 

Definitely will be coming back and trying to break that 8 hours barrier though...

It measured altitude accurately but surprisingly the way it measured total ascent / descent was much less accurate.

So back to the drawing board for a new watch, my criteria is:-

Use - trail running and mountaineering, mainly UK.

Accurate ascent/descent and altitude. Needs an altimeter/barometer.

Navigation - breadcrumb at the least. Ability to upload gpx files. Colour maps nice but not essential.

Battery - at least 24 hrs (need to be able to use in navigation mode for up to 24hrs).

HR monitor - after my experience with the 9 I really have zero confidence in these now. But if there is an accurate one i'd be interested, otherwise I have a chest belt so this feature is not essential.

Design - it would be nice to have a sleek design for a change. The Spartan/9 Baro are cumbersome under a running jacket sleeve or mountain gloves.

I'm starting a mileage increase phase for a 90k in August, and I'm considering two different approaches. I currently run 5 times a week with two rest days. My mileage is around 50-60k per week and I aim to (slowly) increase to 70-90k per week.

I'm choosing between the following ways to increase the mileage:

1. Run 6 times a week, decreasing to one rest day. This would probably be a run of about one hour in length.

2. Take one of my workout days (I run my WO in the morning) and run once more in the afternoon/evening (easy run). This would probably be a run of 30-60 mins depending on how the schedule for the evening is.

My reasoning is the following.

Pros:
1. I would get a couple of more km in every week compared to 2, and I can do this run in the morning, which makes it less stressful.

2. I would keep 2 rest days each week, and according to a Koop podcast (can't remember which), an extra rest day decreases the risk of injury substantially.

Cons: 
1. I would lose one rest day.

2. Some weeks it might be hard to fit in a second running the evening due to job stuff.

I recently purchased a pair of Lone Peak 5's (still returnable) but I'm not feeling great about the fit. I've been using my Altra Torin 4 for 500+km and am super happy with them and now I'm transitioning more into trail and need some proper trail shoes. I tried to 46.5 EU and they felt slightly too large on the top front part so I ordered and tried a pair of 46s, but they feel slightly too small (short).

So my question is, from your experience how loose has the top toe part been? I felt like there was too much top room in the 46.5s.

Whereas the 46s are slightly too short.

I hope you get the idea of what I'm trying to convey, would love some input from you guys who have LP5's but also what you've experienced from earlier models and/or other Altra Trail shoes.

Koop prescribes steady state runs at an RPE of 7 and as I‚Äôm a bit new to RPE as well as steady runs in general, I‚Äôm looking for a rough HR equivalent.

For reference, I typically run (with estimated RPE):

- very easy/recovery ~125-135bpm (RPE 4-5)
- easy/endurance ~135-150bpm (RPE 5-6)
- tempo/threshold ~ &lt;178bpm (RPE 9)

Today, I am using the Ultraspire Speedgoat 3.0 waist belt.  I really like it and plan to use it for the race when there are plenty of aid stations,  It holds 1.1L of water, which is just barely sufficient for 3 hours, but as I continue to ramp up (hoping to peak between 20-23 miles)

So I am looking for non-vest options to hold 1.5-2L of water.  Has anyone had luck adding additional bottles to a waist belt?  I've considered also carrying a handheld, but then could never use poles and I suspect it would feel awkward (but I haven't tried!).  I've also considered getting the smallest hiking pack I can find that still has a frame and a hipbelt, like the Osprey Talon 22, but am worried that it may chafe or the water will slosh around a lot.  

Interested to see what strategies others have used!  Worst case, I can do two smaller routes and refill at my car in between (my local routes don't have any water on the trail to purify), but I'm much more interested in staying out the whole time",0.083,0.847,0.07,-0.5866,1522,297,31,13

 I'm looking to upgrade from my old 735xt.¬† my activity are running, MTB and indoor rowing (mostly) and skiing and trekking whenever I'm able to go (I live in Chile, mountains are not too far thoug).

I been looking around, and the natural choice would be a fenix series or FR945 (745 maybe?), but I far from using and understaning the amount of information and complexity tha those options produce - don't misunderstand me they are fantastic watches, but I doubt that I'm gonna use all the features they have. 

The thing is, I wanted to track my activities and have a good measure of them but not ending buying an expensive watch that I'll not use all their capability (likely too bulky)- I really like the recovery advisor of my 735xt thoug.

So I wonder if any one is wearing a Coros Apex Pro (because battery life and comments of their software updates) or a Polar Grit X (brand  history and reliability) that can give some advice and which one should I pick up...or if  I should go for another alternative.

Last year was my first year tackling actual ultras. When I started my training for last year I switched to using Perceived Rate of Exertion to guide the intensity of my training runs (based on Jason Koop's book). 

Before then I had run a variety of sub-ultra distance races. Back then I had setup HR zones on my watch based on my LT (discovered using a track test) and resting HR, using Garmin's HRR% algorithm. Switching to PRE seemed natural to me, as HR seemed really variable on trail and from day to day.

Now I'm training for a 50 mile trail ultra this summer, which will be my longest run with most elevation gain. I'm in the middle of reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and the authors discuss aerobic threshold and heart rate zones *a lot*. They have me thinking about my aerobic base again, and I'm questioning if my PRE 4-5 runs really are under my aerobic threshold.

Let's say I do an aerobic threshold test and discover I'm aerobic deficient. Do I go back to use HR to guide my runs? Try to readjust what PRE means to me? Am I overthinking this?",0.006,0.95,0.044,0.867,1285,231,66,17

* **When?** Late 2017

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| B | Don‚Äôt die | *Yes* |
| A | Finish race | *YES* |


### 1: Disclaimer and 2: what the hell am I talking about:
1: Don't do this shit. 2: I got the brilliant idea of running an ultramarathon on LSD after a bucket list discussion at work. Doing things like climbing everest and running ultras came up, as did taking some of the drugs you've never tried. I thought that combining these things would make for a fun year to remember.

### Training
Running back and forth to work on weekdays (about six three miles one way) in order to prepare for running a 50 mile ultramarathon. Long runs on weekends. Taking LSD to see if I can handle it.  I could, and I enjoyed it enough to keep going with my experiment.

Running one 10K event on LSD: it was a success and the most fun I‚Äôve ever had in a night!  

### Pre-race

The wife drove me to the starting line out in the woods as I was still sleeping. Thank you wifey. 

I felt like an outsider once we got to where the race was starting off. Everyone was wearing stuff that looked like it was designed for running, while I was wearing woolen underwear and gray gym shorts and a green hoodie above them. Others were wearing skimpy hydration packs, I wore an old hiking backpack I had used while backpacking over in Europe. And everyone and their mother had these GPS watches that probably cost more than all of my stuff + race fee combined. 

I was surprised to see that 3/10, maybe even 4/10 of the runners were women. A large number of the men were bearded. How many of them had plastic bags of LSD in their pockets I didn‚Äôt know, but they were quiet a hippie-looking-bunch of people none the less. 

### Race
### 

It was dark when the race started at six in the morning, and it made for a cool atmosphere with all the headlamps when the gun went off. Some 150 people I would guess were there to prove themselves during the day that followed. 

The hoodie went into the backpack fast as I got warm from running. We ran the first part of the race next to a lake that reflected all the stars, which was nice. While those aiming for glory and first place had sprinted off in the beginning, most people where still in one big pack. Hearing the all the shoes hit the gravel in unison had me feeling this was much more of a teams sport than it was. People were talking about what prior races they had run, what injuries they had fought over the year and what nutrition they had brought. While I didn‚Äôt find myself all that interested in the subjects other runners were bringing up, one of the biggest surprises was how connected I felt to the people I was out with. Running an entire night with a group of people like could probably be a spiritual experience on its own.


### Ninety Minutes after ingestion - where is my high?
Ninety minutes had passed since I had put the tabs of LSD in the mouth, and I had run some 15 miles and taken nearly 30-thousand steps according the the wife‚Äôs Fitbit on my wrist. On 200 micrograms I would definitely have expected to be tripping by now, but I was kinda bummed out thinking this wouldn‚Äôt work out until really I found myself really sad thinking of all the people who died and lost friends and family in the 2004 tsunami. All feelings are amplified on psychedelics, but I would have very much liked another feeling than sadness to amplify on this day. 

At least getting distracted was easy thanks to the girl in the ponytail I started following who held a good pace for me. Focusing on their hair swinging left and right like a pendulum made for a good thing to focus on. The packs had thinned out some time ago, and now people were sorted by speed into different groups - I had made my way from one of the slower ones to one that was a bit more ambitious. 

I was admiring the woman ahead of me. She was quite obviously well trained by the looks of her legs and butt, but I felt strongly connected to her to the point of embarrassment when I thought about how we were both out here on this day going through the same hardships. 

Was I in love? I don‚Äôt know, but I remember thinking about our potential life together. Full of running adventures all over the world, and our babies would be genetically engineered to be great endurance athletes. It got me feeling very warm, but also crying. Splitting with the wife who I had been with for more than 10 years would be hella tough, but I had to be true to myself. Of course I was just high, and not in love, but it was very much the reality I was facing at the time. 


Like the last time I had run on LSD, the visual effects were greatly diminished. Things were fluid, wavy and non-solid, but it was very mild compared to what I would usually be seeing on this kind of dose. Could the tabs I had brought be under-dosed? Sure, you can‚Äôt really know how much you are getting, but the other effects were still going strong. The body was constantly tingling, and it felt like an electric current was going back and forth in my body powering me. Sometimes I felt light as a feather, and at other times I felt more like a brick. 

The path went mostly on trails through the woods. The area was very beautiful, and I thought about how lucky the people who lived on the farm I passed during the sunrise where. I wanted to live on a farm!

### Super Mario:

I was in a two man pack followed by a mustache-clad man in a red windbreaker jacket. I called him Mario, and he had followed me for some time now. If he knew how far out I was at the moment he wouldn‚Äôt be, but following the red stripes that showed the way made for easy navigation ever someone as high as I was. But when the red stripes disappeared, he acted as if it was my fault the we had gotten a bit lost. ‚ÄúJust brilliant!‚Äù he had exclaimed before he turned back. Luckily I could follow him on the way back to the trail, and we had only been a little bit off. 

He seemed to care about his time, unlike me. I only wanted to finish the race. But why? I wasn't sure. Why does anyone do anything?


### Doesn't taste like anything to me!

The halfway point was coming up, and I had already done the longest run of my life. Almost a marathon on LSD - not bad at all, I must say! While there had been moments of sluggishness, I had mostly felt very energetic since the drug had started to work its magic on me. I was no longer in love with ponytail girl, but we kept running into each other every now and then, and mustache man I assumed was far ahead of me. 

After a grueling hill me and ponygirl reached the aid station on top of a cliff, overlooking a cute little lake. A volunteer asked me if I wanted something to drink, and I said please. Talking was difficult with  my jaw clenching, and I had to resist a sudden urge to giggle. I noticed how weird her expression was: patches of skin on her face were twirling in spirals, and her large nose was growing and shrinking rapidly. Nothing in her face really made sense. I got a coffee from her and filled up on water, and sat down alone on a nice rock, from which I could see Mr. Mustache eat and talk with some other runners.  

There were snacks and food available here, but I went for the egg and avocado sandwhich I had brought with me. I hadn't eaten since last night, but I wasn't hungry at all. Which was for the best, because when I took a bite I couldn't feel taste. It was just texture of the food, which disgusted me. I spat out the mush, and the aid station coffee as well. Undrinkable. At least the day was nice, and as I sat down the hallucinations started to grow stronger. What looked like waves swept over the forest below, and the cliffs surrounding the lake moved up and down like whack-a-moles. Suddenly I felt as if I was in a bubble underwater, and the words b, fourteen, down came back to me. What did they mean?

As I heard ponytail girl crack and joke and others laugh at it, the bubble popped, and I was back, ready to hit the road. And despite having run 24 miles, longer than I had ever run before, I wasn‚Äôt really that tired. Is LSD a performance enhancer? I don't know, but it definitely is a pain and fatigue remover. 

###That time LSD made me gay. 

I could not move my gaze from his butt. The cheeks were like two bowling balls of pure muscle, sculpted by Michelangelo himself. They were firm, yet at the same time bouncy. How the hell would I tell my darling wife that I now liked men? Is this what LSD does to you - or was it the running? 

Whatever it was, I was now gay. What man wouldn't be, when looking at that fine piece of man-butt in front of me? 

### Old men, green particles, and the end of it all

I'm not gonna lie - that later half was tough. Real tough. I was coming down, the peak was gone, and I had been running as if it was my day job. Often walking too, I must say - no first time ultrarunner runs the entire distance on his first race. At times I questioned myself wondering why the hell I was doing this. Was I having fun? I was in pain. Especially during the asphalt sections that popped up every now and then. The lungs worked fine, but it was the constant pounding on the legs that was wearing me out. 

As I stopped to pee I felt as if I  was surrounded by green particles flying in the air. I could see them both with eyes open and closed, and it was very comforting. Many times during the few LSD trips I had undergone I had felt like there was someone watching over me, a force of some kind, and it was good. Even if it was my mind making up this feeling, it felt real enough.  

The green particles stayed with me for the much of the remainder of the race, and it did ease my pain somewhat. How the mind does that is strange, but that's what it did. I had a feeling that I would be experiencing this even if I hadn't taken any LSD earlier, but that was impossible to know.  Maybe this was the real runner's high that some athletes talk about? 

Someone who seemed to be in a lot of pain was the old man me and a group of four runners passed with only a few miles to go. He must've been sixty years old, and he was limping, and took a break to hold on to his knee when we reached him.  We had been out for shy of ten hours, and just now were we catching up to this dude who looked like he could have grown up grand-children. That was impressive. Who knew how long he had been limping out here? He told us it was ok to keep going, and that's what we did. As did he, slowly limping his way to the finish line. 

Ultramarathons are for most people not very comppetetive. It's about finishing, and for some people, it's about finishing while tripping on LSD. But as I and two other runners reached the road that would in only a few hundred yards lead to the finish line I noticed one of them picking up the speed behind me. Game on! his friend shouted ""I'm not doing this!"" but as long as there are two, ther there are enough people to tango. 

Soon we were on a racetrack, torches on both sides of it, and at the end was the finish line. It looked like the kind of place where tribes would sacrifice virgins to appease the ancient gods, and I could hear my wife shouting at me as I reached the bend that took me to the final stretch of the race. My lungs were screaming for air - we had been keeping a hard pace for at least half a mile, and now we were side by side with only one hundred meters to go. Not even  Usain Bolt would have been able to run past any of us then and there! The man next to me gave it all, but so did I - and a little more. I was faster than him, but we were both winners, both smiling just as much. I couldn't imagine a better way to finish my first ultramarathon.


### Post race thoughts:
 
I was proud of myself when I finished. I hadn't just finished a 50 mile ultramarathon in 10 hours and 23 minutes  - I had finished an almost year long project. Sure, I hadn't made the world a better place nor had I invented something cool, but I had stuck with something tough for the first time in my life. The LSD part had been really fun, and psychedelics had shown me another piece of the world I didn't know existed, but I think what I had learned was how rewarding it felt to.. do stuff. A friend who had hiked the Appalachian trail had talked about the sense of  purpose he had felt during that ordeal, and that was how I felt during this whole thing. And now what?

As me and the wife headed home in the car, I spotted the old man limping on the road leading up to the finish line. I was impressed with what I had accomplished, but this dude was built with stronger bricks than most. Why the hell would he keep going like that? Then I remembered one thought I had been having a few times over the race  - sometimes it is at your worst, you feel the best. 


What followed the next few days was pain. So much pain, especially during toilet visits. How anyone runs even longer events was hard to fathom. But despite this, it didn't take long for me to sign up for another ultramarathon, which I would do sober. And guess what? I twisted my knee and had to drop out. Perhaps a sign I shouldn‚Äôt be racing with a clear mind. 

More LSD adventures? A few, but no more more reckless run/trip combos. Last LSD trip was 2019. Some slight interest to redo this one day, but nothing serious.

Can someone explain the pros and cons of Bright Angel versus South Kaibab as a starting/ending point? I understand Bright Angel is right near the GC parking lot and therefore great from a transportation (albeit longer than SK). I will be going alone, so I am trying to figure out if it's worth it to park at visitors center and walk the 2.8 miles to the SK trailhead then make my way across. Alternatively, I could start at Bright Angel and cut out the walking distance to SK but have that distance ""tacked on"" during the run itself. I won't be able to get a ride from the visitors center to SK.

My last post got a great response and I was able to get back running in about a week so I am currently training for a 40 Miler, the first week in April.  My longest previous run was a solo marathon last summer.  My current plan is to run 20 next Saturday followed by 21 the following day (ending about an 85 mile week).  My question is, should I include a run that is 30+ miles after that or continue to focus on back to backs?",0.014,0.935,0.051,0.644,456,95,11,5
ultrarunning,1614097237,"Patellar Tendinitis Recovery and tips - Looking for advice! Hi everyone,

I've been experiencing Patellar Tendinitis for about 5/6 months now. I've ran on and off (mostly trail runs) for the past 1.5 years but massively increased my training from Sept '20 onwards and most of it was road running. I started to feel knee pain and eventually went to a physio who told me to do a few things to strengthen my quads and glutes, he said to keep running. 

I then did a silly thing and ran the Yorkshire 3 peaks (40k) and afterward, my knee was fried. 

I didn't run again for weeks to let it heal and went to a physio who basically said id overdone it too quickly. 

I've been doing eccentric decline squats, progressing from two legs, to one leg, and now adding weight). 

I've been doing this religiously but I feel like I'm not making any progress. Most of the time when I perform the exercises it hurts, I get the odd day when it doesn't. The physio said to slowly start to run again as in for 5 mins, then 10, then 15.. which I did, but it got too sore again so I just stopped and decided I wanted to fully heal before I try and run again.

Obviously, I'm itching to get back to running BUT i want to heal.

I've been doing these squats for probably about 9 weeks now and I'm starting to feel a little deflated.

Has anyone else found anything else that works for them?

Willing to try anything at this point!

ultrarunning,1613998358,"Am I on track for my 50k goal time? Not experienced as a runner so wanted some outside opinions on my progress (+ advice) as I don't have much to compare to. Race goal and recent TT results below. Appreciate any feedback.

My target race is early September, 54km (33mi) trail race with 1,100m (3,600ft) vert, is my target time of &lt;4hr30min realistic? It would require an avg pace of &lt;5min/km (8min/mi).

I turn 30 in a month or two, height 188cm (6""2), weight 74kg (163lbs), active but never a runner per se. Football (soccer) in high school, 5 years military, exercised on and off over the past 5 years. I've always been in ok shape, like I could run a 5k in under 30min 'off the couch', but not much of training history as a runner specifically.

I started running in Nov 2020, after 15 weeks decided to do a HM TT to see where I'm at, results below. This was run doing multiple loops, with one short, steep climb accounting for the vert on each lap, the rest was flat asphalt/trail.

HM TT
Time: 1:35:17
Pace: 4:31min/km (7:15min/mi)
Elevation Gain/loss: 194m (636ft)

This was run consistently at 85-90% maxHR (estimate as I don't know my true MHR) at the end of week 15 of training, no taper or extra rest just did this as my long run. Big effort, had nothing left when finished.

Training to date:
Weeks 1 - 12 were base building up to ~70km (45mi) per week with almost no running done above an RPE of 6, last 3 weeks have been at ~80km (50mi) per week with 2x hill sprint sessions per week (12 x 1min max effort on 6 - 10% grade). Running done on a 50/50 split between road and trail, average about 10m per km in vert (about 50ft per mile) in elevation gain.

Plan is to do another 3 week block of hill sprints, then around 8 weeks of tempo running work, then 12 weeks of specific work for the race itself at lower intensity but higher mileage (peak 120km/80mi per wk).",0.044,0.909,0.047,0.0931,1882,341,46,16

ultrarunning,1613961375,"Help Finding New Trails Is there an app or website that can filter trails based on vert/mile? I am currently living in midwest (Michigan) and looking for the closest 1500+ ft continuous climb. I have been trying to use AllTrails, Gaia, Trail Running Project, etc. to find trails with a lot of climb, but it only allows me to filter based on mileage and elevation gain independently. This has caused me to miss some potential trails. Is there something out there that can allow me to find feet climbed/mile for a trail? (Or does anyone know of big climbs near MI?! Best I have found is 2,500 ft climb 7 hours south near TN)
